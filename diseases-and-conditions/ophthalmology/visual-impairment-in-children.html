  <h2>Overview</h2>

Good vision in a child plays an important role in his training. According to statistics, vision problems are detected in one child out of 20 preschoolers and one in four students. Due to the fact that many of the troubles with his vision is just beginning at an early age is very important that children receive proper care of their eyes. Untreated eye problems can have serious consequences, as well as adversely affect the ability to learn, in school, and even a particular character. Below we present a number of problems with vision, with which the parents may face in practice:<br><br>

- Blurred vision (amblyopia) is the weakening of which can not be corrected with glasses only;<br>
- Strabismus (strobizm) is a condition where the eyes look in different directions and do not focus on one subject;<br>
- The inability to distinguish colors (color blindness) is a condition where the eye react to color, but have difficulty with the definition of a single color;<br>
- Variety of lesions of the retina syndrome (Terry), there soon after birth, some premature infants undergoing changes in blood vessels of the sensitive membrane of the eyeball, which can permanently damage the eyes of the child;<br>
- Nearsightedness (myopia) when the image does not focus on the retina, and in front of her, resulting in blurred distant objects;<br>
- Farsightedness (<a href="/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/hyperopia.html">hyperopia</a>), the image is focused behind the retina, rather than on the retina, resulting in difficulty seeing people up close. In children, the eye lens is adapted to the problem and has made great efforts to provide clear images both far and near, but these efforts often lead to body fatigue the eye, and even to squint;<br>
- Defocusing (<a href="/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/astigmatism.html">Astigmatism</a>) - is usually the result of the irregular shape of the cornea. People with astigmatism typically see vertical lines clearer than horizontal, and sometimes vice versa;<br>
- Ptosis of the upper eyelid (ptosis), a defect in which the eyelids may be slightly lowered, or may even completely cover the pupil. There are cases where the defect may limit or interfere with normal vision, which requires surgical intervention, but in some cases can help and medicines;<br>
- Inflammation of the eye (<a href="/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/conjunctivitis.html">conjunctivitis</a>) is characterized by a typical discharge, watery, irritated eyes;<br>
- Poor night vision (night blindness), a person sees a good day but at night or at dusk bad eye perceives objects;<br>
- Damage to the eyes associated with some sports.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

- The child has a wandering eye and looks in a different direction than the other eye (you need to watch carefully, because this symptom may be faint). It should be wary, even if it manifests itself only in moments of fatigue or <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a>;<br>
- To examine an object, the child himself to help, turns his head, his head leaning to one side or one shoulder much higher than the other;<br>
- Squinting or covering one eye, excessive blinking, squinting;<br>
- Violation of hand-eye coordination;<br>
- Problems associated with the movement in the space of a child hits the standing items, drop things on the floor;<br>
- A child holds a book or other object is too close to the eyes;<br>
- The child closes one eye or covers it with his hand;<br>
- The child is often lost in space and gets tired easily;<br>
- The child rubs his eyes during reading, after a brief reading, the child has his finger on the line when reading, the child is able to read only for a short time;<br>
- The child complains of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headaches</a> and eye strain;<br>
- Nausea and <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/dizziness.html">dizziness</a> when the visual load;<br>
- Motion sickness;<br>
- Double vision.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

If you have any symptoms to show the child's doctor.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

The ophthalmologist observes the child's health history and development of defects of vision, conducts tests on visual acuity, the errors resulting from inadequate refractive eye for nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, blurred vision, crossed eyes, eye coordination, ability to focus the eye, control eye movements, spatial vision and reactions to color. The doctor is obliged to conduct a comprehensive examination, prescribe glasses, contact lenses, or assign a therapeutic treatment.

<h2>Preventive measures</h2>

- To identify potential problems early on, kids should undergo eye exams, starting in infancy and preschool children. Regularly, at least once a year, show your child's specialist;<br>
- When the classroom with your child keep toys at a distance of not less than 30 inches from your eyes, hang moving objects as the separation distance;<br>
- Do not store medicine and chemistry in the area of ??children's access in order to avoid injuries;<br>
- Do not expose your children's eyes to direct sunlight in the room, do not place the crib in front of the blinding light, walks in the stroller use with your child wear a tent or a cap;<br>
- Briefly trim nails to prevent child injuries, which he can afford to inflict, or wear his gloves;<br>
- Wipe the eyes of a child from the inner corner of eyes to personal hygiene, always use clean cloths;<br>
- Ensure proper lighting on the desk of the child, the furniture should be the desired height to ensure correct posture;c
- In times of strong focus and let the child in his eyes a rest from time to time, especially with video games or computer, if your child spends a lot of time on the computer, consult with an ophthalmologist as soon as possible to avoid possible problems with your vision.
