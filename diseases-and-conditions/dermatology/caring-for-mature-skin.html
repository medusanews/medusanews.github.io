  Mature commonly referred to as the skin in women aged 35-45 years. In this age the skin starts to decrease production of collagen - a special protein responsible for its elasticity. The skin becomes dry and dull, and shows the shallow and deep wrinkles. Particularly rapid areas around the eyes and mouth, where the skin is thin and delicate, and neck. Even normal skin, is never delivered to the problems of their happy owner after 35 years begins to require special care.<br><br> However, if the time to start taking care of your skin, you can permanently delay the aging process and maintain radiant, healthy complexion, clearly defined oval.<br><h2> The problems of mature skin</h2> After 35 years of slow pace of the sebaceous glands, so the skin becomes drier. Decreased production of collagen, so the skin gradually begins to lose elasticity and moisture, there are small wrinkles. Several worsens blood flow to the skin, which is why it seems less rosy and elastic. Finally, decreased production of new cells, slowing the process of regeneration, the skin begins to age. Many women have dark spots.<br><br> Do not forget that the skin at any age, and especially in the mature is a mirror of human health. After 35 years of great importance for the appearance of the skin of factors such as diet, sleep, rest, and psychological state of the person.<br><h2> Some common problems</h2><h3> Smoke</h3> Beginning at age 35, women should quit smoking (if they smoke).

Hence, lethargy and gray skin color. In addition, nicotine promotes the release of free radicals.<br><br> If you can not quite quit smoking, limit up to five cigarettes a day. Do this not only for the youth of the skin, but also for overall health. Also, remember that smokers need more vitamin C from time to time take a course of this vitamin.<br><br><h3> Exposure to sunlight</h3> Exposure to the sun accelerates the aging process of the skin. Ultraviolet rays penetrate deep into the skin, destroying the important components of cells, dried collagen and elastic fibers. As a result, the skin becomes dry and her wrinkles and liver spots.<br><br> Do not go out in the sun without sunscreen. And out of that house in the sun, use such creams in both summer and winter. Creams, sun screens, are of great importance especially for mature skin, as they reflect UV rays and prevent unsightly pigmentation (so-called age) spots.<br><br><h3> Lack of motion</h3> Some women after 40 years in sports in the fresh air.

A healthy diet helps to ensure a skin nutrients it needs to repair damage caused by the sun and other elements of the environment.<br><h2> Skin Care Basics</h2> Mature skin lacks both oil and water. Therefore, when using cleaning agents pay attention to the fact that they are not "pulled out" of the skin or fat or moisture. Refuse soaps, including gel and synthesized. Use a cleansing milk.
