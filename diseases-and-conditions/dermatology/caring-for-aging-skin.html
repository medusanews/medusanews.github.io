  If the first signs of skin aging appear about 35 years, after 45 signs of aging become more pronounced deep wrinkles appear, somewhat &#8220;blurred&#8221; contour face, the skin becomes very dry and dull. Such skin, women over the age of 45 years, referred to as aging. To make a woman feel young and attractive at that age, her skin requires thorough daily care.<br><h2> The problems of aging skin</h2> <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/dehydration.html">Dehydration</a>, dryness, wrinkles are the main problems of the aging of the skin after 45 years. This is due primarily to the fact that the lipid layer of the stratum corneum does not have time to fully recover. Is a weakening of the functioning of the sebaceous glands and sweat glands (deterioration of the water-lipid balance of the skin), decrease in the number of capillaries (microcirculation disturbance), which is why the complexion is no longer fresh and healthy, reducing the number of fibroblasts (weakening of collagen elastin), which leads to significant dehydration of the dermis. Decreased production of melanocytes (increased sensitivity to UV light) is a reduction of the rate of cell division of the basal layer (slow updates and a thinning of the epidermis), a decrease of enzyme activity, leading to inhibition of all metabolic processes. As a result, the skin becomes flabby and sagging appearance, deformed eyelids and face oval shaped frontal wrinkles and pronounced nasolabial folds.<br><br> All of these processes are associated with genetically programmed changes in the body, as well as a reduction in the synthesis of hormones in the body: growth hormone, testosterone, DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) and melatonin are produced in sufficient amounts only to 20 years of age, and they are essential to the physical health and regeneration.<br> In addition to the natural processes of the body and the negative impact of the environment, there are many factors as to seriously affect the appearance of the skin: alcohol, smoking, poor diet, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a>, lack of sleep, improper medicines. So do not forget that careful attention to the way of life with the best care for cosmetic tweaks.<br><br> Skin aging complex and lengthy process.

Remove milk residues from the skin with a dry cloth cosmetic, do not rinse. Do not wash your face with hot water, avoid changing the contrast of hot and cold water, because it can lead to the appearance of rosacea (spider veins). Protect your skin from the wind and cold in the winter time.<br><br> Never use products containing alcohol, as it is very dry skin. Carefully select and color cosmetics, especially the tone, powder and blush.

Today, professional beauticians offer its customers a large number of hardware techniques for eliminating wrinkles. Among them, dermabrasion, microdermabrasion, laser resurfacing. In addition, there are different types of chemical skin rejuvenation primarily middle and deep <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/dermatology/peeling.html" title="Peeling">peeling</a> with fruit acid and other acids. Most of these methods require at least 1 week for the rehabilitation of the skin, some have contraindications, and in case of errors in the conduct of the procedure may lead to serious consequences.

However, be aware that they provide only a temporary effect.<br><br> The most radical way to eliminate wrinkles is plastic surgery.
