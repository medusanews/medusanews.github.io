  <h2>What is the keloid scars?</h2>
Keloids - a special type of scarring, penetrating into the surrounding normal tissue.<br> The growth of keloids usually starts 13 months after healing of the wound.<br> Unfortunately, skin scars are the inevitable consequence of any open injury or surgery. They remain for a lifetime, often creating a significant cosmetic and functional defects. Disfiguring scars, scars that limit even small movements can cause serious problems in patients, both in business and in personal life.<br><br> Keloids occur with equal frequency in men and women. They have been described in different age groups, although more common in patients aged 10 to 30 years old and rare - in the very young and very old age. There may be a family history of keloid formation.
<h2>The causes leading to the formation of keloids</h2>
The reasons for such a breach are uncertain.<br><br> Wound healing - is a complex biological process, which lasts about a year and ends with the formation of a mature scar. One year later, the scar tissue will continue to change, but very slowly and unobtrusively.<br><br> In some cases, the normal scarring process is broken. The reasons for this are numerous: <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/burns.html">burns</a>, festering wounds, the lack of an adequate comparison gaping edges, high tension surrounding the wound of the skin, especially the immune system, genetic predisposition, etc. Then, instead of the usual flat or concave shaped scar protruding from the skin scar, and in rarer cases - keloid scar.<br><br> Keloid continues to increase even after 6 months of education and usually do not decrease and do not soften. Typically a lack of communication between the severity of the injury and the severity of keloid scars, which can occur even after a minor injury (injection, insect bite), and often after the burn. Stabilization of keloid scarring usually occurs within two years after its occurrence. Characteristically, keloid scars are almost never ulcerate.
<h2>Manifestations of keloid scars</h2>
- Keloid growth usually begins after 23 weeks after healing of wounds with tight seals in the thickness of the scar tissue and lasts from a few months to several years<br> - Pain in the area of injury<br> - Increased sensitivity in the area of injury<br> - Itching and burning in the area of injury<br> - Solid smooth rise above the surface of the skin scars with clear boundaries<br> - At the beginning of the disease may be mild redness or paleness of the skin in the affected area<br> - The scar occupies a larger area than the original injury<br> - Even after years of keloid scars continue to grow and may form a claw appendages.<br><br> Most keloid scars develop on the ears, chest, shoulders, back of the neck, at least - on the joints. There have been cases of keloid scars on the face. The children on the spot burns keloid scars can form on any part of the skin.<br><br> Development of scarring occurs in four stages:<br> Epithelialization stage - means that the injured area is covered with a thin film of the squamous epithelium, in 7-10 days starts to grow coarse and slightly thickened, the color of pink it becomes faint. In this state, the scar is 2-2.5 weeks.<br> Stage swelling - is characterized by an increase in scar tenderness in contact with him, the scar is raised above the skin. After 3-4 weeks the pain is reduced and the redness increases, getting cyanotic (bluish) tint.<br> Stage seal - the scar is sealed all over, covered with dense plaques focally becomes lumpy and looks like a keloid.<br><br> Step softening in normal scar fades, becomes soft, movable and painless. In the case of keloids, this stage does not occur, and the nature of keloid scar save.<br><br> In terms of species keloids are divided into young and old. Tactics of treatment of these two forms are fundamentally different. Young keloids - it keloids with a lifetime of 3 months to 5 years. Characterized by strong growth, have a smooth shiny surface and color from red to cyanotic. Older keloids - it keloids with a lifetime of 5 to 10 years. Characterized by rough wrinkled surface, sometimes - ceasing the center, paler color than young keloids.
<h2>What can a doctor do?</h2>
The diagnosis and treatment of keloid scars carries a dermatologist.<br><br> There are several methods of treatment.<br><br> In order to prevent the formation of keloid scars using pressure on the affected area.<br><br> Apply bandages, creating pressure on the injury site, for 612 months. The bandage can be removed not more than 30 minutes per day.<br><br> Hormones in the treatment of keloids is used for failure brace.<br><br> Surgical treatment of keloids is shown only when the extensive damage and the effectiveness of topical treatment with hormones. Note the high recurrence rate, so surgical treatment is preferably carried out not earlier than 2 years after the formation of keloids with carrying out prophylactic treatment immediately.
<h2>What can you do?</h2>
Do not self-medicate. If you are injured, it is necessary to see a doctor urgently. Treatment of keloid scars and a lot of them to choose the correct sequence or combination can only be a specialist.<br><br> If you keloid scars NOT:<br><br> 1. Trying to burn scar &#8220;celandine&#8221;;<br> 2. Squeeze suspicious of education, especially in the upper chest and shoulders;<br> 3. Massage the scar;<br> 4. The sauna, solarium / tanning;<br> 5. Take hot baths.<br><br> After the treatment for another year you will need to observe the scar (or rather what was left of it), and at the slightest sign of activity to visit a doctor who treats.
