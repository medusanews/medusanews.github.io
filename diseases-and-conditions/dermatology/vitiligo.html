Vitiligo(Pes, leucopathy, piebald skin) - one of the most unexplored and difficult to treat diseases.

This phenomenon is called depigmentation.<br><br> The disease is common in all countries of the world.

In recent years, an important role for violations on the part of the immune system, there is evidence of an autoimmune pathogenesis of vitiligo.<br><br> Depigmentation (bleaching) can provoke worms (helminths), disrupting the normal functioning of the endocrine glands and resulting in a deficiency of copper in the body. Held in such cases deworming helped cure patients.

Lesions may be single or multiple, located anywhere on the skin, most often in the open: on the face, neck, upper and lower limbs of large folds of the vulva, anus.<br><br> The centers are usually symmetrical, sometimes there are one-sided lesions are often localized along the nerve trunks. In areas of hair change color, pale, sweating and sebum secretion violated, and vasomotor reflexes, muscle-hair (bleached skin loses its ability to respond to cold and other stimuli in which a so-called &#8220;goose bumps&#8221;).<br><br> Vitiligo often accompanied by a solar dermatitis.<br><br> The most pronounced degree of vitiligo is universal defeat, when the entire skin becomes pigmented.<br> Of subjective sensations in patients with vitiligo No worries them is usually only a cosmetic defect. Some spots may disappear spontaneously. The patient should avoid prolonged exposure to the sun, since tanned skin white spots stand out stronger.<br><br> With the progression of vitiligo is depigmentation lesions appear in the field of recent injuries in areas of friction or pressure on the skin.
<h2>What can your doctor?</h2>
The diagnosis of vitiligo is made on the basis of the clinical picture and in most cases is not difficult because of the characteristic clinical manifestations of the disease.<br><br> A number of factors that contributed to the Vitiligo causes the need for a comprehensive treatment of the disease.<br><br> Vitiligo is a difficult problem to dermatologists because of the lack of a clear line of treatment, despite the emergence in recent years of several cause-based approaches to therapy. Use of drugs that increase the skin&#8217;s sensitivity to UV rays, followed by irradiation of them.<br><br> Full treatment of patients is impossible without comorbidities. Vitiligo - &#8220;cutaneous marker of internal disease&#8221;.<br><br> At present, the search for effective treatments for this disease.
