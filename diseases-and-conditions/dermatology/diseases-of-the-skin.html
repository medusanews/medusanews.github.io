  <h2>General</h2>
The skin - the largest organ of the human body. Skin covers and protects the bones, muscles, internal organs and helps to regulate body temperature. Of the skin, nails and hair often reflects the overall condition of the body and are an important part of a person's appearance. With some of the problems of the skin, hair and nails can manage on their own at home. In many cases, you may need the help of a doctor. Doctors who specialize in skin problems, dermatologists are called. In some cases, problems with the skin <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/allergology/allergy.html" title="Allergy">allergy</a> decide.<br><br>
<strong>Black dots (open comedones)</strong> - is clogged sebum on the skin pores. Most often they appear on the face, chest, shoulders and back. The appearance of blackheads due to a violation of the sebaceous glands of the skin and is most often in adolescence. Black or dark gray color due to oxidation comedogenic substances in the blocked pore. The contents of blackheads can be removed doctor.<br><br>
<strong>Dermatitis (also a rash or eczema)</strong> - an inflammation of the skin, which is reflected in the appearance of dry red, itchy spots, similar to the scales. The rash may be due to different reasons: allergies, irritations and various diseases. There are several types of dermatitis: atopic dermatitis, contact <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/dermatology/dermatitis.html" title="Dermatitis">dermatitis</a> (an allergic skin reaction caused by contact with an irritant) and seborrheic dermatitis (itchy and flaking of the skin and scalp).<br><br>
<strong>Dry and sensitive skin</strong>. If you have dry skin often has irritated, peeling, and even a little itchy. Sensitive skin reacts immediately to a number of external factors: temperature, wind, various chemicals, etc. Sensitive skin often becomes dry, irritated and reddened. Dry and sensitive skin often becomes feet below the knee, back of the hands, forearms and face. This may be due to the excessive use of soap, active cosmetic and perfumes, skin aging, long-term administration in the bath or shower water is too hot or too vigorous rubbing with a sponge or washcloth.<br><br> Urticaria happens when a stimulus causes the cells to release histamine. Histamine in turn causes vasodilation. Fluid accumulates under the skin and produce large, red, often itchy blisters, called papules. Sometimes they are like mosquito bites. When urticaria such blisters usually appear once a lot, but they are different size from a pea to 4-6 cm in diameter. They usually pass quickly, in just a few hours. The causes of urticaria often remain unclear, but some people know that certain foods, beverages, or medications can cause them hives. Acute urticaria (eg, associated with taking drugs) can stay on the skin for days. Chronic urticaria (often of unknown origin) can last for weeks. Severe outbreaks of hives can be dangerous, especially if the papules appear on the lips or throat. With a strong hives can even be observed swelling, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/dizziness.html">dizziness</a> and loss of consciousness.<br><br>
<strong>Scabies</strong>. When <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/scabies.html">scabies</a> skin appear small, highly itchy blisters. The causative agent of scabies is itch mite. Mites live deep in the skin where the females lay their eggs. Within 5 days the eggs hatch into new insects. Itching does not appear immediately, but after about a few weeks after the mites have settled on the skin. If you have symptoms of scabies, see your doctor. If you do have scabies, your doctor will prescribe lotion that kills mites, knowledge and recommendations for prevention. All members of the family should also be used to prevent a special lotion. To relieve the itching, you can use non-prescription antihistamines. Be sure to thoroughly wash it in hot water all the linens and other hygiene items.<br><br>
<strong>Scars</strong>. Scars are marks on the skin that is left after the accident, surgery or disease. Scar formation is a natural process of wound healing when tissue replacement fills the damaged area. The more serious the injury, the longer the wound heals and the greater the likelihood of scar formation. Scar formation, size and color depend on its location on the skin and age. On young skin scars heal faster and leave less residue. The skin in the lower part of the face is quite thin, so scars was usually more noticeable. At the beginning of scars look darker and wide, and then gradually fade. To improve the appearance and self-masking can use cosmetics. To improve the skin condition can be used OTC products containing allantoin, silicone, and other substances.<br><br>
<strong>Pigmentation disorders</strong>. Violations of pigmentation (skin color), this is the wrong distribution of pigment in the skin that can be caused by a number of factors. Among the most common causes: too intense exposure to the sun, scars, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/dermatology/vitiligo.html" title="Vitiligo">vitiligo</a>, melasma, photosensitivity, and malignant <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/melanoma.html">melanoma</a>.<br><br>
<strong>Wrinkles</strong>. Wrinkles are one of the most visible signs of aging. The skin loses its elasticity, and the tissues begin to sag. In the formation of wrinkles, collagen and elastic fibers are compacted, making the skin loses its elasticity.<br><br> When you have different variations of the skin, seek medical attention. Sometimes it is very serious diseases begin with the innocent at first glance, the changes.
