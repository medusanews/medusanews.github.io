  <h2>Overview</h2>

Headache - this is one of the most common complaints. Although most headaches are not a sign of serious illness, yet there are times when it requires medical care. If the headache is stronger than ever before, you urgently need a doctor. If you are pregnant and you are headache, discuss this issue with your doctor. About 90% of all headaches are one of three categories: tension headaches and headaches associated with increased blood pressure, cluster headaches and migraines. Tension headaches are often accompanied by muscle tension back and shoulders. They can be caused by emotional and psychological <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/depression.html">depression</a> and anxiety. Problems with pressure are the most common cause of headaches. If you have chronic headache (more than 3 times a week for several months), contact your doctor. Cluster (they say histamine-dependent) headaches are usually very strong. Mostly they are middle-aged men. Cluster headache rapidly increases and lasts from 30 minutes to 2 hours. No signs of predicting the occurrence or the end of an attack of cluster headache does not exist.

<h2>Causes of Migraine</h2>

Migraine is associated with changes in nervous system, release of certain chemicals in the brain, and dilation of blood vessels. Possible triggers of migraine include hunger, fatigue, bright lights, alcohol, caffeine, anxiety, stress, certain medications, environmental factors and certain foods.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

Symptoms of tension headaches include:<br><br>

- A constant throbbing headache;<br>
- A sense of tension and pressure in the head and neck;<br>
- Discomfort, which does not increase or only slightly increased during the execution of daily affairs.<br><br>

The ability to relax through meditation, hypnosis, music and video support, and stress management techniques can help prevent tension headaches.<br><br>

The symptoms of cluster headaches include: - a constant sharp pain in the eye, often repeated in the same time of day - red eyes, watery eyes and stuffy nose (on one side of the face) - swelling of the eyelids eyes. If you have a cluster headache is not recommended to take lying down, it can only worsen the condition. Conventional non-prescription pain medications may not help against cluster headaches. Consult your doctor, he may prescribe special medication or suggest other methods of therapy.<br><br>

Symptoms of migraines include:<br><br>

- Throbbing with increasing degrees of intensity pain;<br>
- Pain is often concentrated in one half of the head;<br>
- Pain that is aggravated by walking and any activity;<br>
- A painful sensitivity to light;<br>
- A nausea.<br><br>

About 20% of people who suffer from migraines, seeing bright spots or flashes of light immediately before the next attack of headache. These symptoms are called an aura. Some people before an attack of migraine is a sharp burst of energy. In most cases, migraine requires professional diagnosis and care. Consult your doctor and discuss your treatment. Your doctor may prescribe medication to relieve pain.<br><br>

If you have rare headaches that do not cause much discomfort, you will be able to handle them yourself. It is recommended to see a doctor for recurring headaches, headaches that appeared after a <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/head-injury.html">head injury</a> during the past 18 months, as well as severe headaches, lasting more than 3 days. If a headache accompanied by nausea and <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a>, if the pain is very sharp and severe, if the headache is accompanied by <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a> and stiff neck (inability to press your chin to your chest), or the weakness of the arms and legs or numbness, difficulty in speech, hazy vision, irregular gait, it requires an immediate appeal for medical help.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

Do special exercises to relax. Ask your doctor to show you these exercises. Take nonprescription pain relievers such as aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain relief. However, they should not be abused. Too frequent use of these drugs can lead to so-called recoil effect, and headaches appear again. Children do not give acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), as it can lead to a dangerous condition called Reye&#8217;s syndrome (hepatolenticular syndrome). Try to relax, rest or sleep in a dark quiet room, keep your head elevated. Apply a cool compress on his head to ease the pain. Take a cool shower. Massage the muscles of the neck and shoulders.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

Frequent or very intense headaches require treatment of a doctor. Only a doctor can accurately determine the cause of headaches, if necessary, after further examination. And the doctor will prescribe the appropriate treatment and, in some cases offer hospitalization for detailed examination and selection of therapy.

<h2>Preventive measures</h2>

Headaches of any type is recommended to conduct a special diary. This will determine the most frequent causes of headache. In the diary should bring information about meals, sleep, exercise, work and home affairs. Women should also record information about menstruation, as hormonal changes can also affect the headache. To prevent headaches, and avoid any triggers that you were able to determine with the help of a diary. Try to follow the regimen. Eat at about the same time, 3-6 times a day, in small portions. Get enough sleep, go to bed and wake up at the same time, do regular exercises or sports. If possible, avoid stress. Headaches are often the result of fatigue, stress, emotional disorders. If you smoke, it is recommended as soon as possible to quit the habit. Smoking can trigger or exacerbate them.
