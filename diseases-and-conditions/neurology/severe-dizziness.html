  <h2>Overview</h2>

Dizziness - a general term denoting a general weakness, confusion of consciousness, loss of balance or sense of rotation. Dizzy spells usually do not pose a great threat to health, but sometimes they may be based on serious disorders (<a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/stroke.html">stroke</a>, brain tumor, anemia). Mild dizziness, occurring in the form of episodes of confusion of consciousness, confusion can arise when turning the head in different directions, changing the position of the head, and when a person stands up from a chair or bed. These attacks of vertigo lasting less than a minute. More severe vertigo may last several minutes, hours or even days and is accompanied by symptoms such as loss of balance (with the risk of falls), unsteady gait, impaired hearing, nausea, ringing in the ears and blurred vision. During this attack, you can feel the sharp weakness, as if you can pass out. These attacks occur in diseases of the inner ear, anxiety, hyperventilation. Some people have <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/dizziness.html">dizziness</a> occurs when rising too quickly from a sitting or horizontal position. This type of vertigo, which occurs with a change of position, also known as orthostatic hypotension and caused a sharp outflow of blood from the brain during a sudden change of position. In this rapidly declining pressure in the vessels supplying the brain. What to avoid this condition, you need to get up is not sharp, gradually. Before you stand up, sit on the edge of the bed or chair to find a foothold. When lifting the leg muscles must be stretched, so that more blood will flow to the brain. There are other causes of vertigo. These include <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/dehydration.html">dehydration</a>, high blood pressure, heart disease, anxiety. Be sure to tell your doctor if you suffer from <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/hypertension.html" title="Hypertension">hypertension</a> or heart disease, and you feel dizzy.<br><br>

If you have problems with balance becomes difficult to walk straight and upright. There is a feeling that the legs thin on the ground, and that now you will fall. This type of balance disorder is a serious danger, since the fall there is great risk of injury. Impaired ability to maintain balance is often caused by age-related changes in the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear (labyrinth), reduced sensitivity of receptors balance of the lower limbs and joints, arthritis and poor vision. Consult your doctor if you feel unable to keep his balance or losing a sense of reliance on their feet. To protect yourself from a fall, or turn off the lights at night, clean carpets, as about them, you can trip over, walk with a cane or a special stick.<br><br>

In the system there is a sense of rotation of dizziness, spinning, twisting of the surroundings. It also may have nausea, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a>, and flies before my eyes. This type of vertigo is usually transient, not a great danger to life, and he is due to a violation of the semicircular canals of the inner ear that are responsible for maintaining equilibrium. These disorders include labyrinthitis, benign positional vertigo and Meniere&#8217;s disease.<br><br>

<strong>Labyrinthitis</strong> is an inflammation of the inner ear, usually a viral etiology. In this state of equilibrium in the centers of the brain are stimulated excessively, resulting in a sudden significant imbalance, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and involuntary movements of the eyeballs. These symptoms may occur suddenly during the day, but sometimes a person may wake up with similar complaints. Severe vertigo can last for several days. Fortunately, labyrinthitis usually subsides over time and is not repeated. It usually takes several months to complete disappearance of symptoms. During this time I appear transient feeling of loss of equilibrium in certain head movements, or when certain of its position, and a condition called benign positional vertigo. Benign positional vertigo occurs only when a change in head position (usually when you turn in bed, tilting the head backward and anterior). This is the most common form of dizziness in adults. Typically, such a sense of rotation lasts less than a minute and can occur as a once a day, and whenever a man turns his head. Benign positional vertigo can occur as a complication of labyrinthitis, or as an independent disease. It usually takes about 4 months to complete disappearance of symptoms. If you have episodes of severe vertigo, discuss them with your doctor.<br><br>

<strong>Meniere&#8217;s disease</strong> is a consequence of increased sodium concentration in the fluid of the inner ear. With the high sodium content increases the pressure in the space of the inner ear, leading to an imbalance, as well as fluctuations in hearing. This condition is fairly common among adults of all age groups. In patients with marked tinnitus, a feeling of fullness, pressure in one ear. You may also experience nausea and vomiting. Symptoms can appear and disappear, to be moderate and very intense and usually last from several hours to several days. Episodes of violations of the inner ear may be repeated every few days, and may once in several years. In between bouts of Meniere&#8217;s disease, most patients feel satisfactory.

<h2>The reasons</h2>

- A sharp rise from a sitting or lying down;<br>
- Hunger, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a>, high temperature;<br>
- Diseases of the optic apparatus;<br>
- Some drugs, alcohol;<br>
- A sharp elevation to a higher altitude (the plane), because at high altitudes the oxygen content in air is less than on earth;<br>
- Motion sickness.<br><br>

Dizziness can be a sign of more serious diseases:<br><br>

- Anemia;<br>
- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar);<br>
- Heart Disease;<br>
- Temporary partial blockage of blood flow in the arteries supplying the brain;<br>
- A heavy blow to the head;<br>
- Subdural hemorrhage (<a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">bleeding</a> into the space between the membranes covering the brain);<br>
- Brain tumor.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

Intermittent dizziness and a feeling of disorientation, weakness when climbing out of bed.<br>
Imbalance, a feeling of whirling surroundings, lasting more than three days.<br>
Imbalance, combined with nausea and vomiting.<br><br>

A sense of disorientation in space combined with <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a>, hearing loss, tinnitus or pain in the ear.<br><br>

A sense of disorientation in space with a <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/head-injury.html">head injury</a>, or severe <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headache</a>.<br>
Dizziness with a feeling of numbness, weakness in the limbs and involuntary urination and defecation.<br><br>

Dizziness and flies before the eyes or double vision, hearing loss, slurred speech.<br>
Loss of balance in conjunction with symptoms of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/shock.html">shock</a> (rapid pulse, rapid shallow breathing, cold, wet to the touch, pale face.)<br><br>

Loss of balance and a sense of pressure or <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/pain-in-the-chest.html">pain in the chest</a>.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

If an attack of vertigo starts when you get up quickly, do it slowly, slowly. If you are feeling at the moment an attack of vertigo, slowly sit down and take a reclining position. In this case, the less likely that you will fall and injure themselves. If you feel that you may lose consciousness or have dark eyes, sit so that the head was between his knees.<br><br>

Drink plenty of fluids, it helps to avoid dehydration and to maintain normal blood pressure.<br>
Avoid alcohol, caffeine, smoking.<br>
Do not drive.<br>

If you feel an attack coming on vertigo, do not close your eyes and focus your eyes on any one stationary object. So you can reduce the intensity of discomfort.<br><br>

If your family members also feel dizziness, headache, or complain of nausea or vomiting, it may be due to carbon dioxide <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/poisoning.html">poisoning</a>. Immediately exit to the street and ask for help from the hospital.<br><br>

Consult your physician if dizziness lasts a long time, often repeated, becomes more intense, or is accompanied by visual impairment, hearing loss, numbness or weakness in hands and feet.
