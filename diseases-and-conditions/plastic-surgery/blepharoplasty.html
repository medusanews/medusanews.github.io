  How to return the youth and freshness of view, when no makeup, no special creams are no longer able to help? Salvation - a blepharoplasty.<br><br> FOREVER - YOUNG EVERMORE<br><br> This cosmetic surgery - blepharoplasty, removes excess skin and fat on the upper and lower eyelids, making the face more energetic and young.<br><br> Eyelids age earlier than other parts of the face, for every minute they work: we blink, narrows his eyes. In addition to the upper and lower eyelids are practically no sweat and sebaceous glands, causing the skin is weak, thin and dry. Moreover, with age brow ptosis that creates excess skin on the upper eyelid. Most women themselves do not notice because, by imposing makeup, eyebrows lifted. But the signs of elderly age is always visible to others.<br><br> An important difference between the upper and lower blepharoplasty that upper eyelid surgery can not only remove excess skin, but also remove part of the circular muscle. When the operation of the lower eyelid muscle is not necessary to dissect. If it is damaged, it is slightly reduced and after healing of the eyelid formed two prominent tubercle.<br><br> Upper eyelid blepharoplasty is considered one of the most aesthetic cosmetic surgery.<br><br> It is not necessary to hope that blepharoplasty rid of wrinkles around the eyes. Remove them with a laser or injections of botulinum toxin. And be prepared for the fact that after blepharoplasty of the lower eyelid contour change it up a bit.<br><br> RAISE ME FOR EVER<br><br> Blepharoplasty resorted to not only those who are faced with the age-related changes. Frequent customers and cosmetic clinics are quite young. Typically, this is a girl with a congenital problem of bags under the eyes. Guilty of these fatty <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/surgery/hernia.html">hernia</a> and weak muscles from birth age. Get rid of bags under the eyes by transconjunctival blepharoplasty: the surgeon makes an incision laser is not outside, under the lash line, and from the inside, gets to the desired area through the mucous membranes.<br><br> By transconjunctival blepharoplasty removes only the excess fat and fatty hernia, but not excess skin. From the latter removes only the outer lower lid blepharoplasty. That is why the transconjunctival blepharoplasty is more suited to young people who do not yet have excess skin in the area.<br><br> Another reason to appeal to the surgeon - epicanthus, overhanging skin fold of the upper eyelid in the inner corner of the eye, typical Mongoloid type of person.<br><br> Operation on Epicanthus called plasticity eastern eye.<br><br> Also in the clinic come people suffering from ptosis and blepharochalasis, diseases in which the upper eyelid skin loses its elasticity, becomes thin, loose, finely pleated, in the form of a hanging bag. A person with vision problems begin to see something, we have to throw his head and raise his eyebrows. Lift the lids can only blepharoplasty surgery.<br><br> TRACKS AND CONSEQUENCES<br><br> Blepharoplasty surgery of the upper eyelids lasts about 40 minutes, and the lower - about an hour. Last somewhat more complicated upper blepharoplasty because of the risks such unpleasant complication is ectropion century. This happens if the surgeon is overdone, and cut off excess. To avoid the inversion of the century, plastic asks the patient to look up and open your mouth, then it will be visible excess skin, from which you want to get rid of. If you do not, after surgery there will be no supply of the skin and eyelids open will become bare sclera and the whites of the eyes. After a while, your skin will have &#8220;imp&#8221;. For the restoration take a shred of skin with either the upper eyelid or behind the ear.<br><br> After blepharoplasty can immediately go home or stay in the hospital overnight. In the first 3 days of the patient&#8217;s condition deteriorates more: show through bruises, swellings appear. For ever impose stripes sterile patch to relieve the swelling of the area, and on the fourth day of the condition improves. After 7 days of recovery occurs, the doctor removes the stitches and assigns rehabilitation facilities - physical therapy and thermal procedures that can be performed in the home. For example, can be applied to the eyes of teabags. It moistens the mucous eyes.<br><br> If these days the patient must leave the house, she can use makeup to hide the bruises. After a week and a half after the surgery makeover will no longer need to hide the flaws, but in order to enhance the beauty. Yet the process of scarring is fully completed in 2 months after blepharoplasty.<br><br> Track from blepharoplasty is minimal. Thin pale scar will be neatly tucked away in the natural fold of the upper eyelid. At the lower eyelid blepharoplasty, the incision is made under the lash line, scar is almost invisible, and may eventually disappear altogether.<br><br> Outside blepharoplasty lower eyelids, tend to make the wake of a circular face lift. After lifting clearly visible excess skin of the lower eyelid, which facilitates operation and improves the overall effect. But you can make the right set of operations. This will give the face a more youthful and healthy appearance, goes sagging, eyes visually increase.<br><br> CHOOSE ANESTHESIA<br><br> When blepharoplasty is often used Rausch-narcosis, shallow short-term general anesthesia, when the output of which the patient feels no discomfort.
