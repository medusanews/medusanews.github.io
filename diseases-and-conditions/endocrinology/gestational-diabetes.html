  There is a form of diabetes that sometimes develops during <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> (3-5% of cases), whose pre-pregnancy have never increased the level of glucose (sugar) levels. This is called gestational diabetes, it develops only during pregnancy, after about 20 weeks. The causes of gestational diabetes is not known. During pregnancy the placenta produces hormones necessary for fetal development. If these hormones block the action of the parent insulin, gestational diabetes occurs. This gives rise to a condition that doctors call insulin resistance (insensitivity of cells to insulin) and blood sugar level rises.<br><br>

If a woman suffers from diabetes, or gestational usual, this excess supply of glucose accumulates in the body of the fetus and converted into fat. Children with excessive development of the subcutaneous fat layer there is a risk of damage to the shoulder bone during delivery. In addition, these infants pancreas produces increased amounts of insulin to dispose of the request by the mother glucose. Therefore, they may experience low blood sugar. Also, such children increases the risk of respiratory disorders in the future, they have increased the likelihood of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="Obesity">obesity</a>, as well as adults likely to develop type 2 diabetes.<br><br>

Gestational diabetes usually ends after delivery. Mothers who had gestational diabetes during the first pregnancy, the likelihood that it will occur in subsequent pregnancies is approximately two-thirds. In addition, some of them may develop later type 2 diabetes. Sometimes after pregnancy can manifest type 1 diabetes or type 2, which the woman did not know before pregnancy and who require compulsory treatment.<br><br>

Risk factors for gestational diabetes:<br><br>

- Senior age for pregnancy. Pregnant women over the age of 40 years, the risk of gestational diabetes is twice higher than the 25-29-year-old pregnant women.<br>
- In the presence of diabetes in close relatives of a woman's risk of gestational diabetes increases by more than 1.5 times. If one parent has diabetes, the risk is almost doubled if both parents nearly tripled.<br>
- Belonging to the white race is not.<br>
- A high body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy. BMI ranging from 25 to 29.9 doubles the risk of diabetes and a BMI over 30 triples it. Women rise 150-180 cm and weighing 70 pounds has a BMI of 25. For a woman the same height weighing 84 pounds BMI is 30.<br>
- Weight gain during adulthood. A high BMI at age 18, followed by weight gain of 5 to 10 pounds during pregnancy leads to a higher risk of diabetes.<br>
- Smoking.<br>
- The birth of a child with a mass of more than 4.5 kilograms, or stillbirth for unknown reasons in history.<br><br>

Every pregnant woman should be examined for diabetes in the period from 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. If the blood test, the doctor assumes you have diabetes, it can hold another confirmatory test, during which time you will need to drink a glucose solution of certain concentration, and then a few <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/blood-test-total.html" title="Blood test (total)">blood test</a> for sugar in a fixed time. Most women do not require insulin for the treatment of gestational diabetes.

<h2>The reasons</h2>

The causes of diabetes are not fully understood. But we know that diabetes can be caused by:<br><br>

- Heredity;<br>
- An autoimmune disease in which the immune system destroys the cells of the pancreas that produce insulin;<br>
- Viral infections, damaging the pancreas, which can then run the autoimmune processes;<br>
- Lifestyle and diet.

<h2>Symptoms of diabetes</h2>

For 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes: high blood sugar.<br>

For gestational diabetes most weight, an increase in the amount of urine, severe thirst, decreased activity, loss of appetite.

<h2>Complications of diabetes</h2>

Hyperglycemia - a condition closely associated with diabetes, is the sharp rise in blood glucose levels. This occurs when the body produces little or not enough insulin or if the sensitivity of the receptor cells to insulin is reduced. The state of hyperglycemia is typical for patients with diabetes is the cause of many complications that occur in those suffering from this disease.<br><br>

Hypoglycemia medical term for low blood sugar. Hypoglycemia is usually a complication of diabetes and is rare in healthy people. (If the person is not suffering from diabetes, hypoglycemia occurs, usually a sign of serious illness, such as insulinsekretiruyuschey tumor or liver disease). Severe hyperglycemia (very high blood sugar) in combination with a high content of acidic metabolites in the body can lead to confusion and fainting.<br><br>

High blood pressure, heart disease, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/stroke.html">stroke</a>, diabetic kidney disease.<br>

Blindness (due to vascular lesions of the retina), <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/cataract.html">cataracts</a> and other disorders of vision.<br>

Slow healing of wounds.<br><br>

Gangrene (tissue necrosis), because the blood supply to the tissue breaks down or even stops. Usually gangrene affects the big toes and feet.<br><br>

Frequent infections, especially infections of the skin and soft tissue, vaginal infection.<br>
Numbness in the extremities due to neuropathy (nerve damage) with the loss of sensitivity, especially in the feet.

Prescribe drugs for diabetes or insulin injections if necessary.<br>
Your doctor can teach you how to use the device for measuring blood glucose levels, to explain to you how and where to inject insulin, so you can make them yourself.<br>
Watch for the possible development of complications and assign timely treatment.

<h2>Preventive measures</h2>

Try not to eat refined sugar, honey, do not abuse the sweets and other carbohydrates, fats and salt. If you are overweight, try to reset it. Exercise regularly.

If your family has diabetes and you are more than 40 years, check blood glucose levels 2 hours after a heavy meal.
