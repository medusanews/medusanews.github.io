  The author of this diet Dr. Peter D'Adamo first proposed that different people need different food.<br><br> CELEBRATION OF DIVERSITY<br><br> It has long existed a great variety of diets for patients: lady's finger, cores, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/urology/gout.html">gout</a>... A healthy diet also offered one - a kind of ideal or optimal nutrition. Each specialist defended his version of universal health diet - but never one.<br><br> Father and son Adam to break this tradition and said that healthy people are also not the same. They differ in the type of metabolism, and to maintain the health they need different food.<br><br> Summarizing his observations practical nutritionist, naturopath, Adamo Sr. found a relationship between blood group of patients and the way they react to a particular food. So, some lose weight and recovered on carbohydrate-vegetable diet, while others lost their power from such a force and often ill. Over the years, accumulated a huge amount of such observations, so that the practice of dietetics stronger theory. This compares favorably with the system Adamo on many other, more slender and evidence-based, but often do not confirm the finding in life.<br><br> The recommendations take into account the blood group, often do not coincide with our desires, tastes and habits.<br><br> This is natural: in fact dismiss the national and family traditions is impossible. If your grandmother baked every morning hot pancakes for breakfast, chances are you'll love them dearly all my life, despite the first blood group, gastritis, hyperacidity and abnormal carbohydrate metabolism. And your health!<br><br> You can safely ignore the advice Adamo, if eating "is not their" products, you are healthy, energetic and feel good. If there is a problem with the well-being and being overweight, should try to follow these recommendations and see what happens.
<h2>Essence of the theory</h2>
In short, it is the people with the first group of blood (0) are descended from the ancient hunters, who ran for a mammoth with a stone ax or collect edible fruits and roots. People in the second group (A) are descended from farmers, with the third (B) - from the nomadic herdsmen, and the fourth group (AB) quite young, and turned from the mixing of the second and the third. Each blood type has its own characteristics.<br><br> Between the blood and food intake, as explained by Peter D'Adamo, a chemical reaction, the nature of which depends on the blood. In particular, blood groups gives different pathological response to different lectins - proteins with laminating action.<br><br> Foods contain many different lectins. If our body is not able to neutralize them, mankind would have long since died out. The effectiveness of our defense is quite high: about 95% excreted lectins, and only about 5% fall in blood or appear in the digestive tract. In the blood, they destroy red and white cells in the gut and cause inflammation of the mucous.<br><br> We can not completely exclude the lectins from the diet, but we can avoid products that are hostile to our cells.<br><br> This is to avoid: simple restrictions will not help. For example, one of the lectins contained in the common wheat. Communicating with the small intestine, it causes inflammation mainly in people with the first group of blood (0).
<h2>Group 1 (0)</h2>
Its owners have the hardest. Useful meat and herbs, wheat and corn are contraindicated in all forms, cabbage and cauliflower, potatoes, milk and most dairy products. Almost all grains are harmful: of them descendants of hunters gaining weight. In our country, such a diet is particularly difficult: not no bread, no potatoes, no cereal, no cabbage, no milk... However, since the supports of the first group of blood is usually energetic, confident and have the makings of a leader, such a diet - a good reason to use a strong will to succeed and earn a piece of lamb with onion, jellied sturgeon with horseradish sauce and a dish of salad greens all year round.<br><br> "Favorite" disease of people with first blood - clotting disorders, inflammation (arthritis, colitis...), thyroid dysfunction, ulcers of the stomach and intestines, allergies.
<h2>2 group (A)</h2>
The descendants of farmers should not eat meat, especially red, dairy products and wheat. People in this group is easy and useful to be vegetarians. They are ideal diet with lots of soy products, vegetables and fruits, vegetable fats. At the same time it will serve meals prevention of heart disease, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancer</a>, type 1 diabetes, anemia and liver diseases, which tend to carriers of the 2nd group of blood.<br><br> From vegetables to avoid eggplant, potatoes, white and red cabbage, tomatoes, mushrooms and greenhouses, as well as yellow, green and fiery cayenne pepper. Of undesirable fruit citrus, banana, mango, papaya, coconut (including chips). From the seafood you can eat cod, salmon, carp, whitefish, pike and mackerel, but avoid eggs and crab, squid, flounder, shrimp, and herring. Of cereals particularly useful buckwheat and wheat is harmful only.
<h2>3 group (B)</h2>
Descendants of nomads from the third blood group is flexible and a great adaptation to changing conditions. These people are blessed with good health, but they are more likely than others, diagnose rare diseases - <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/chronic-fatigue-syndrome.html">chronic fatigue syndrome</a>, autoimmune - <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/multiple-sclerosis.html">multiple sclerosis</a>, type 1 diabetes.<br><br> Carriers third group tolerate milk, eggs and various meats, chicken only be excluded from the diet. Not very useful in all kinds of pork. Harmful crabs, shrimp, crayfish, and almost all shellfish. Avoid vegetable oils except olive oil and flaxseed oil. Cereals and pulses - not the best choice: rice and oats are well tolerated, but from corn, wheat, buckwheat, rye, and barley should be abandoned.<br><br> You can eat all the vegetables, except tomatoes, radishes, olives, avocados and artichokes. Of fruits are especially useful pineapples, bananas and grapes, as well as plums and cranberries; recommended to avoid pomegranates, persimmons and coconut.
<h2>4 group (AB)</h2>
The fourth group of blood - the youngest. It combine the properties of the second and the third. Like those who have this blood type, they tolerate dairy products and bad - chicken. Wilt and gaining weight from beef, but get stronger and lose weight from soy proteins and seafood, as representatives of the second group. Regular moderate intake of meat allows you to fight with a tendency to anemia, and plenty of fresh herbs, vegetables, soy and algae serve as prevention of cancer and heart disease.<br><br> Useful rye bread, oatmeal, millet and rice in all forms, but it should give up the corn and buckwheat. Showing beans, lentils, peas. Seafood is very good salmon, cod, sea bass, mackerel, and pike river.
