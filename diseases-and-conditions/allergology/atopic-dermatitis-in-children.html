  <h2>General</h2> The term <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/dermatology/atopic-dermatitis.html" title="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</a> (diathesis) parents are usually used to describe skin redness, blemishes and other skin eruptions child. In a professional environment such changes on the skin called atopic <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/dermatology/dermatitis.html" title="Dermatitis">dermatitis</a> (ie, inflammation of the skin of an allergic nature).<br>
And the term "diathesis" refers to a predisposition to certain diseases or inadequate response to conventional stimuli.<br><br>
Atopic dermatitis in children is not uncommon, due to several factors. After the birth of a child in the body is experiencing very serious adjustment. They affect the most vital systems, including the immune response. From the warm, cozy and safe mom kid gets in an aggressive environment that is trying to attack him every day different allergens. Gradually learning the body gets used to it and formed a correct immune response, which subsequently protects a person throughout life. But while all these changes will not end, the children unusually prone to allergic diseases. Mom eats a slice of peach or strawberry and an infant who feeds her milk, a rash appears, the same can occur with the introduction of certain foods. And so it begins when children try orange or tangerine... allergies to medicines, to the vaccine on a mosquito bite or a bee on flowering plants - with one of these situations usually faces every mother.
<h2>The causes of allergic dermatitis</h2> It will be understood that the child diathesis cutaneous manifestations are not skin disease. This is only a manifestation of an allergic skin reaction. Because of the immaturity of the immune and digestive system, detoxifying the liver failure, some substances enter the body does not digest. They can not be completely digested in the intestine or liver can be neutralized. These substances from certain transformations acquire properties antigens and induce the production of antibodies. Antigen-antibody complexes provoke a rash.
<h3>There are three ways of getting the allergen in the child's body:</h3>
- While eating or drinking food allergy;<br>
- By direct skin contact contact allergy;<br>
- In the process of respiration respiratory allergy.
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Symptoms diathesis (atopic dermatitis) are varied areas of reddening of the skin, rash of red spots, stains and spots, often itchy, flaky and dry skin, cracks, sores and ulcers.
<h2>Complications</h2>
These complications include allergic dermatitis, skin infection due to the penetration of bacteria in the wound in the field of scratching the skin.
<h2>What can you do?</h2>
First of all, make sure that the cause of the rash is an allergic disease. To do this, call the pediatrician who exclude possible infection and diseases of the skin.<br>
If food allergy, it should give a long term ingestion of allergen (if known), and all products that are highly probable source of allergies (citrus, as, indeed, any other exotic fruit, vegetables, strawberries, chocolate ). If the <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/allergology/allergy.html" title="Allergy">allergy</a> developed during the introduction of complementary foods, try to stick to the following rules: be administered not more than one new product for 1-2 weeks. If a child has reacted negatively to the new product, you will know exactly at what, it is necessary to cancel the administered product, give the child a week to rest and begin the introduction of another product. Lure, which caused a negative reaction, you can try again in two months. New food better offer the child at the end of feeding, possibly mixing with the old (known to the child) food, ranging from a quarter teaspoon and gradually increasing the dose.<br><br>
Contact allergy can occur in the components of detergents, fabric from which sewed clothes, or the material from which made toys. Use only the special children's baby powder or soap. After washing the latter is better to carry out rinsing in water, which is not filtered or chlorine, or boiled. When bathing children, even soap and shampoo is used no more than a maximum of two times a week, so k any soap neutralize the protective lipid film, which is coated with leather.<br><br>
Atopic dermatitis by inhalation of house dust particles, various sprays, animal, insect repellents do not occur in babies less frequently. But such an allergy requires parents to serious and sometimes harsh measures. Disclaimer of beloved pets and spotless cleanliness in the house - sometimes the only way out of this situation. Please be aware that reducing animal allergens in a residential area begins just a month after the expulsion of two pets out of the apartment.<br><br>
Note that the use of any medication in a child with diathesis child requires special care. Try not to use any drugs without a doctor's prescription. Remember, too, that the funds in the form of syrups contain a variety of additives (colorings, flavorings) that can cause or exacerbate allergies.
<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>
Confirming the nature of the allergic rash, the doctor will prescribe an adequate diet. To relieve symptoms and reduce the itch diathesis children prescribed antihistamines, including outdoor applications, and in more severe cases - steroids. If the nature of the allergic reaction is not clear, and the state remains without improvement for a long time, you may be advised to carry out a patch test. By identifying the specific allergens and removing them from the child's diet, you can greatly help him. In some cases, prescribe and fecal intestinal bacteria overgrowth. Children with recurrent severe allergic reactions may require allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT).
<h2>Prevention of allergic dermatitis</h2> 
Prevention diathesis includes <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/mammalogy/breast-feeding.html">breastfeeding</a> duration and compliance with nursing woman diet, appropriate complementary feeding, breast-feeding competent and timely detection of intestinal dysbiosis. Atopic dermatitis is usually temporary. As the child grows improved liver function and intestinal immune system. There is even a term "outgrow allergies".
