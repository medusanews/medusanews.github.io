  <h2>General</h2> <strong>Allergy</strong> - it is an acute response of the immune system of the body to normally harmless substances. Allergies can occur at the wool of some animal species, a variety of foods, dust, drugs, chemicals, insect stings and pollens. Substances that cause an allergy, called allergens. In some cases, allergic reactions occur so slowly that you may not even know that in general suffer from allergies.<br><br> But allergies can be, on the contrary, it is extremely dangerous and even life threatening. In people suffering from allergies, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/allergology/anaphylactic-shock.html" title="Anaphylactic shock">anaphylactic shock</a> may occur serious pathological condition associated with extremely sharp reaction to the allergen. Anaphylaxis can be caused by various allergens: drugs, insect bites, food. Also anaphylactic shock</a> can occur due to skin contact with an allergen, such as latex.<br><br> Food allergy is an immune reaction caused by certain foods and is accompanied by well-known symptoms. A <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/allergology/food-allergy.html" title="Food allergy">food allergy</a> occurs when the body mistakenly thinks is a product of a threat to health and the self-defense forces the immune system to produce antibodies. Repeated dose allergen immune system already knows this stuff quickly and immediately reacts by producing antibodies again. These substances and cause allergic symptoms. Food allergies are almost always develops in such a way.<br><br> In some cases of allergy in adults are observed in childhood.

People with other allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma or eczema, often suffer from allergic rhinitis. These allergies are more common in women than in men. In allergic rhinitis symptoms may include: itchy eyes, throat, nose and on the palate, sneezing, and stuffy nose, watery eyes, mucous discharge from the nose, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/conjunctivitis.html">conjunctivitis</a> (redness and pain in the eyes.) In severe cases of allergic rhinitis can trigger an asthma attack (in people suffering from asthma), and/or eczema.<h2>The causes of allergies</h2> Some people's immune system reacts to specific substances (allergens), producing various chemicals. One of them, histamine causes allergic symptoms. The body's reaction can occur through inhalation, skin contact, the introduction of an allergen or receiving it in food. Allergens can be animal dander, feathers, dust, foods, cosmetics, medicines, pollen, cigarette smoke.<h2>Allergy symptoms</h2> Allergic reaction may occur on different parts of the body, and the symptoms can last from a few minutes to several days.<br> - The upper respiratory tract: hay fever, asthma,<br> - Bloodshot, watery eyes;<br> - The pain and inflammation of the joints;<br> - Urticaria, eczema,<br> - <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/diarrhea.html">Diarrhea</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a>, upset stomach.<h2>Complications</h2> - Anaphylactic shock (severe allergic reaction)<br> - Shortness of breath or wheezing;<br> - Rapid pulse;<br> - A cold sweat;<br> - Clammy skin;<br> - Urticaria<br> - Stomach cramps;<br> - <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/dizziness.html">Vertigo</a><br> - Nausea<br> - Collapse (acute vascular insufficiency)<br> - <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/seizures.html">Seizures</a>.<br><br> If you do not care a severe allergy can be fatal.<h2>What you can do</h2> Mild Allergic reactions can cause a runny nose, watery eyes, and other symptoms resembling the common cold.

Anaphylaxis can occur within 15 minutes after ingestion of allergen, so you need to take immediate action (you should call an ambulance).<br> Avoid food, drugs and other substances to which you have ever had an allergy.<br><br> About your allergies should be known to your friends, family and colleagues. Always tell all doctors (including dentists, beauticians, etc.) about all your allergies, especially to medications. This applies to both prescription drugs and OTC funds.

When you sweep or vacuum cleaner, knock the dust from the furniture, change linens and any other contacts with dusty objects block the nose (use a gauze bandage or a mask). In allergy to pets do not keep them in my house.<br><br> If you have allergies to medicines, always carry a special card that says exactly what medications you are allergic.
