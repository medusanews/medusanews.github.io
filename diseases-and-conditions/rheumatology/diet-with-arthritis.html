  Ongoing research and development do not give a definite yes, that arthritis can be cured or alleviate the condition by removing from the diet or vice versa, adding certain foods. The exception is gouty arthritis.<br><br>

A balanced diet that includes a variety of food the following four major groups, helps to maintain good overall health:<br><br>

- Fruits and Vegetables<br>
- Bread and cereals<br>
- Milk and dairy products<br>
- Lean meat, poultry and fish<br><br>

Try to limit intake of fat, salt, sugar, and there are plenty of fruits, vegetables, bread and cereal. All people of any age is important to have a balanced content of calcium in the body needed to protect against <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/endocrinology/osteoporosis.html">osteoporosis</a>, which can cause vertebral <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/fractures.html">fractures</a> in the elderly, especially women. This is especially important for people taking corticosteroids for a long time. Skim milk and milk products are preferable to use than products from whole milk.<br><br>

<a href="/diseases-and-conditions/urology/gout.html">Gout</a> is the only form of arthritis, in which a change of diet may be favorable. Gout is common in New Zealand, especially among the indigenous Maori and Pacific Islanders. Some studies have shown results of up to 10% of the disease among the population of New Zealand men of mature age, but also in women the disease is common.<br><br>

With gout should avoid eating offal (liver, kidney, tripe, etc.) are also contraindicated for alcohol, shellfish, peas, beans and lentils.

<h2>Wonder how</h2>

You may recommend treatment with a variety of diets, for example, the exclusion of acidic foods or foods of the nightshade family (tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, etc.)<br><br>

If you really believe that any diet or individual product can help with arthritis, for a short time, so be it. However, if the improvement is based only on this belief, it is likely to soon all the symptoms come back.<br><br>

About the use of vitamin supplements is best to consult a doctor because taking good multivitamin complexes may be necessary. On the other hand, very often people take vitamins when they really did not need.<br><br>

Fasting and cleansing diets are sometimes promoted as treatments for arthritis. There is no dokazatelctv any advantages of these diets. On the contrary, they can lead to exhaustion and serious health problems. Other diets are based on herbs, honey, vinegar, etc., but there is no scientific evidence that they help with arthritis.<br><br>

Many people with arthritis try to wear copper bracelets, suggesting that copper is absorbed through the skin and has a positive effect on disease. However, there is no evidence in favor of the fact that these bracelets help, and against it.

<h2>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid / gamma-linolenic acid</h2>

Preliminary studies have shown that a diet low in saturated fats or containing certain fish oils in the group of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (commonly found in cold-water fish such as salmon, tuna, halibut) is supposed to have anti-inflammatory effect in arthritis. Gamma-linolenic acid is a type of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid found in evening primrose oil, black currant and thumb. These oils weaken the symptoms of arthritis.<br><br>

Before taking any supplement, consult with your doctor. Acceptance of food additives can have side effects, and in some cases, additives affect the therapeutic effect of taking traditional medicines

<h2>Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate</h2>

Glucosamine is a major component of cartilage of the joint. Additives derived from the shells of shrimp, lobsters and crabs. Chondroitin sulfate is a component of cartilage, bone and sinew of man. Additives are usually obtained from bovine trachea or pork products.<br><br>

And glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, and useful for arthritis. They protect cartilage from destruction, relieve pain and return mobility. These substances are part of a series of drugs and dietary supplements.

<h2>The control of body weight</h2>

Medical evidence suggests that overweight people are more likely to develop <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/rheumatology/osteoarthritis.html">osteoarthritis</a>. <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="Obesity">Obesity</a> leads to increased <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a> on joints such as knee and lower spine. Losing weight will not only relieve the burden on aching joints, but also increase your ability to training, as well as improve overall health. Losing weight also increases the likelihood of success in surgical interventions on the replacement of joints. Lose weight (especially with a significant excess weight or obesity) is better under the supervision of a physician nutritionist.<br><br>

Exercise is an important factor in the problem of excess weight. Arthritis it is important to choose the right exercise program to help reduce weight, and (if necessary), and increase joint mobility.<br><br>

The best advice we can give - is to lead a healthy lifestyle and balanced nutrition, reducing consumption of sugar and fatty foods.

<h2>Unproven treatments</h2>

Promises of a quick recovery and the miraculous effect of encouraging people with chronic illness. Most products advertised in this way, whether it be drugs, biologically active additives, or medical facilities may be, and not harm, but may be useless and expensive. To avoid falling into the trap, it should consult a physician for any treatments that they are considering.

<h2>Guidelines for Food and Nutrition</h2>

Every day, eat a variety of foods from each of the four basic food groups.<br><br>

- Vegetables and fruits are at least two servings of fruit and 3 servings of vegetables, where a portion is taken: half a cup of cooked vegetables or a potato / apple of medium size;<br>
