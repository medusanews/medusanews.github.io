  An important objective of treatment of such diseases as arthritis, is to reduce the pain and the associated reduction in mobility. These manifestations of arthritis often leads to <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/depression.html">depression</a>. And then there is a desire to find an alternative way of treatment to get rid of the disease and again feel "normal" person.<br><br>

And then your friends, the best of intentions, are beginning to give useful advice. In the books, and from advertising you will learn proven and new medicines that are sure to solve your problems. This is the eternal theme of the faith of people in the healing properties of foods and plants, as well as in traditional healing.<br><br>

Alternative treatments - a general term for various kinds of alternative medicine, usually emanating from the general practitioner and specialist. These include treatments related to the centuries-old experience and practices of different cultures, diet and medications, as well as psychological effects. What to do when a temptation to turn to alternative medicine? Engage in self-education!

<h2>Here are a few important points to keep in mind:</h2>

<h3>The doctor knows best</h3>

Currently, doctors are familiar with the variety of existing treatments, and often they agree to use them to improve the patient's condition. Some doctors are free to propose the inclusion of alternative methods in addition to the basic course of treatment.<br><br>

If you decide to resort to alternative treatments, be sure to inform your doctor, as some methods can provide you with harm (eg, manual therapy is contraindicated in people with certain disorders of spine). Some supplements can cause adverse reaction or even an overdose while taking the previously prescribed medications.<br><br>

Discuss with your doctor the risks and benefits of the use of additional methods and their compatibility with current therapy. Do not stop treatment prescribed by a doctor, considers alternative methods of treatment as a helper, not as a principal.

<h3>How about a "natural" products?</h3>

Natural is not necessarily safer. There are many tools that claim to "natural" origin. But if the product is simply called "natural" and is made from plant material, it does not guarantee its safety in use. You should apply to any facility that you take by mouth or applied to the skin, with the same attention, as well as to pharmaceuticals.<br><br>

Supplements are made from herbs, almost no place quality control.<br><br>

Unlike pharmaceutical prescription and OTC drugs, which must undergo rigorous clinical testing and multistage, for Badam such stringent requirements not.<br><br>

Manufacturers of these drugs are not required to give full information on the packaging about possible side effects and interactions with other drugs. Moreover, they can not specify the full composition of the product.

<h3>How about the doctors of alternative medicine?</h3>

Not all doctors of alternative medicine have a license to operate. Some professional institutions certify their work and have a proper license. Chiropractors, acupuncturists, naturopaths (doctor, treating natural methods, without drugs) and osteopaths generally create their own association, which has certain requirements to the professional level.<br><br>

Check out their identity, they must be willing to give information about their training and the organization in which they are composed. Be sure to have to discuss details of their work experience in a particular disease, to find out where they were taught techniques of treatment, what is their common experience, were there any additional educational programs.<br><br>

The physician should have a long long way to learning to get the proper skills and begin to engage in private practice.

<h3>The placebo effect works at least some time</h3>

What is the "placebo effect"? Let's say you have <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/rheumatology/osteoarthritis.html">osteoarthritis</a>, and you started taking any supplement. All of a sudden pain in the joints disappears. The miracle of healing? More than likely you will feel better because of the so-called "placebo effect". The term used to describe the effect, when 20-40% of patients taking drugs instead of "the sugar pill" (placebo), not knowing that make "dummy" report that they feel better. Although this result can not be explained until the end, experts believe that this is due to human hope and faith in the fact that the medicine will help him. Most of this effect is seen in people suffering from chronic pain. This may be due to the deep conviction of man that he must help the medicine.<br><br>

Serves as the fact that people often resort to alternative methods of treatment during the acute illness. Aggravation can not continue indefinitely, and a decrease in symptoms is often simply coincides with the beginning of the use of alternative methods. But the man could feel better regardless of the medication.<br><br>

The more pain you feel, the more you want to believe in healing. People with chronic illnesses often turn to alternative medicine because they think conventional medicine is not helping them. Doctors agree that this is one of the main reasons, the treatment of patients to alternative medicine. Unfortunately, chronic pain can cause a person to lose sanity, and he takes a risk and try alternative ways of treatment, sometimes controversial, and even potentially dangerous to health. For such people is especially important that they came to a choice of alternative ways of treatment after first consulting with your doctor.

<h3>What are the main areas of alternative medicine?</h3>

<h4>Acupuncture for arthritis</h4>

Acupuncture may be useful as adjunctive therapy for arthritis. It may temporarily relieve pain, but will not restore damaged tissue. Also, there is no evidence that it may be useful in the exacerbation of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/rheumatology/rheumatoid-arthritis.html">rheumatoid arthritis</a>. Acupuncture can help mostly with milder forms of the disease in patients with poor drug tolerability. It can not stop the progression of the underlying disease, although it may help reduce pain.

<br><br><h4>Homeopathy for arthritis</h4>

Homeopathy - a method of treatment for a particular patient who is discharged for him prepared by the drug. This method is used in children and adults to treat a wide range of diseases. Homeopathic remedies include in its membership the vegetable compounds, minerals, and metals. In the world there are more than 3,000 homeopathic medicines.

<br><br><h4>Herbal remedies and biologically active additives (BAA), used for arthritis of the joints</h4>

Preliminary studies with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (found in fish such as salmon, tuna and halibut, and) show that they delay the process of destruction of the cartilage of the joints. It is believed that the use of a diet low in saturated fat has a positive effect on the course of arthritis.<br><br>

The use of vitamins is also very important, because improves metabolism and general condition of the patient.<br><br>

Supplementation can have side effects, and in some cases, they interact with conventional drugs. Before taking any supplement, consult your doctor.

<br><br><h4>Glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate</h4>

Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are the main components of joint cartilage. The use of additives, which include these components may be useful for patients with lesions of the joints. The experience of their use has shown that they are quite safe and can be effective when used in combined therapy in the initial stages of the disease.

<br><br><h4>Other methods of treatment</h4>

Other popular treatments is the use of Matochkin jelly bees, ginseng, apple cider vinegar, honey and other products. There is currently no evidence supporting the effectiveness of these funds. At the same time, some of them, such as bee products may cause severe allergic reactions.<br><br>

Dietary recommendations are also generally regarded as an ancillary activity for the treatment of patients with arthritis. This topic is covered in the article, diet for arthritis.<br><br>

In conclusion we can say the following. Alternative and adjunctive therapy may play an important role in treatment of arthritis. Their use can lead to a decrease in pain and improvement of general condition. But as a self-care, they can not influence the course of arthritis
