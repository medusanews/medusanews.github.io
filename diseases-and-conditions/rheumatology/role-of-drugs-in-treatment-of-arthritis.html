  The use of drugs is an important component of treatment of arthritis, although this is only part of the treatment of these diseases. The success of treatment depends on several factors, including the way of life. At the moment there is no means of guaranteeing cure, so the drugs can only help to cope with the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.<br><br>

Treatment of arthritis depends not only on the successful operations of a physician, but also on the patient. Trusting relationship with your doctor, regular medications, adherence to other recommendations can significantly improve the quality of life.<br><br>

Finding the most effective and safe treatment for arthritis usually takes some time. The most common drugs are selected by trial and error. So when the doctor prescribes medication, it must inform the principal about it, to tell what effect, and when to expect what the side effects.<br><br>

Some of them are sold without a prescription. But in any case, these drugs should be used only after consulting your doctor.<br><br>

Injections of corticosteroids into joints is carried out for the rapid removal of inflammation and pain and restore mobility. Small doses of corticosteroids usually do not cause serious side effects.<br><br>

Doctors sometimes prescribe oral corticosteroids for the relief of acute symptoms of arthritis. With the improvement of the patient&#8217;s condition gradually reduce the dose.
