  To avoid this you need to get ready to visit the doctor. If you are nervous, take a loved one for support. And be sure to advance in the quiescent state, prepare all the issues that you care about and who you want to ask your doctor.

<h2>Do you have osteoporosis?</h2>

The word &#8220;osteoporosis&#8221; is composed of two roots: &#8220;osteo&#8221; - meaning the bone, &#8220;porosis&#8221; - means a porous, spongy. <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/endocrinology/osteoporosis.html">Osteoporosis</a> is a progressive disease in which bone loss and bone thinning. The bones become fragile and sharply increases the likelihood of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/fractures.html">fractures</a>.<br><br>

Osteoporosis is often develops without showing external symptoms, and you can see that the sick, just getting broken.<br><br>

Taking care of your health is, above all, on your own shoulders. Do not hesitate and do not be afraid to ask your doctor any questions related to your health. Only trust an open communication with your doctor give you the best results of treatment.

<h2>Skills Training</h2>

Many people are unaware that they have osteoporosis. The first sign may be broken. Your doctor can determine the osteoporosis by using special tests that measure bone density. If you feel that you have osteoporosis or you are at risk, ask your doctor to review.<br><br>

Risk factors for osteoporosis:<br>
<ul>
	<li>The frequency of fractures</li>
	<li>Female gender (women are more prone to osteoporosis than men)</li>
	<li>family history</li>
	<li>age over 50 years</li>
	<li>postmenopause</li>
	<li>removed ovaries or offensive <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/menopause.html" title="Menopause">menopause</a> to 45 years</li>
	<li>reduced level of calcium in the diet (less than 4 servings of dairy products per day)</li>
	<li>less than 30 minutes a day outdoors</li>
	<li>less than 30 minutes per day of physical activity</li>
	<li>asthenic physique</li>
	<li>smoking, excessive alcohol consumption</li>
	<li>long-term use of certain drugs, including steroids (including hydrocortisone and prednisone), and anticonvulsants.</li>
</ul>
The more risk factors you have discovered yourself, the more likely you have osteoporosis. If you have more than three risk factors, it is recommended to get tested and seek medical advice.

<h2>Prepare to visit a doctor</h2>

We give a rough list of questions you can ask your doctor to better understand the nature of the disease, the limitations which it imposes on life, the necessary precautions, treatment options, etc.<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>What is osteoporosis?</li>
	<li>Who suffers from osteoporosis most often?</li>
	<li>Does osteoporosis occur in young people?</li>
	<li>How do I know that I have osteoporosis?</li>
	<li>How is osteoporosis directly affect my life?</li>
	<li>How can I reduce the risk of fractures?</li>
	<li>What is the difference between osteoporosis from <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/rheumatology/osteoarthritis.html">osteoarthritis</a>?</li>
	<li>How can hormone therapy help?</li>
	<li>I do not want to receive hormone therapy. How can I avoid it?</li>
	<li>What other treatments are available, except for hormone replacement therapy?</li>
</ul>
On some issues, we offer you a brief information that is not immediate medical recommendation, it is solely for informational purposes. Please note, osteoporosis a serious disease that requires mandatory treatment under medical supervision.

<h3>1. What are the normal values in the analysis to measure bone density (DXA)?</h3>

A:<br>

- The norm (T-score -1.0)<br>
- Osteopenia (decreased bone density, T-score -1.0 to -2.5)<br>
- Osteoporosis (T-score -2.5 and below)

<h3>2. Are all necessary to measure bone density?</h3>

A:<br>

No, this test is not included in the compulsory program of health checks. You need to discuss with your doctor the risk factors (age, medical history, family history, etc.) and decide together whether you need to pass this test.

<h3>3. I passed <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/densitometry.html" title="Densitometry">densitometry</a> and my results are within normal limits. Does this mean that I&#8217;m immune to fracture?</h3>

A:<br>

Unfortunately, no. The test does not give an absolute assurance that you will not get any breaks. In addition, bone loss continues to age. Therefore, regardless of test results, it is necessary to take preventive measures.

<h3>4. The test showed that I had osteoporosis, and now my family thinks I should do any active work, as I, too, for something will break. Are these fears justified?</h3>

A:<br>

No. Osteoporosis is undoubtedly an important indicator of high risk of fractures, but not the only one. Habits and lifestyle are also very important factor determining the likelihood of fractures. The diagnosis of osteoporosis means that you need to take certain measures to minimize the risk of fracture. For example, check your home for potentially dangerous places: the slippery surface, threadbare carpets, rickety stairs, untidy wires and so on.<br><br>

In addition, you need to eat more calcium, and together with your doctor to find the right program of exercise and medication to increase bone density.

<h3>5. How often should I change the density of bones?</h3>

A:<br>

Check bone density should be at least every two years.

<h3>6. Why is it important to diagnose osteoporosis and time to begin treatment?</h3>

A:<br>

Osteoporosis is a dangerous disease, because it can lead to serious fractures (spine, hip, etc.) that will endanger your independence and activity. In addition, the development of osteoporosis, bones can become so brittle that the slightest <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a> fractures can occur in the body of the vertebrae, which can lead to a decrease in the growth and deformation of the spine. In a large bone loss of bone can break very easily, which makes problematic the implementation of the easiest home affairs: the work in the garden, farming and so on.

<h2>Surgery, drugs</h2>

Drugs for treatment of osteoporosis may prescribe only a specialist (rheumatologist or an endocrinologist doctor). Others, such as calcium supplements, may appoint a general practitioner. Remember to take any medications and dietary supplements is necessary only after consulting your doctor.<br><br>

Pain and swelling of the joints, characteristic of arthritis and many other diseases of bones and joints, are not typical for osteoporosis, so most likely you do not have to use painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs.<br><br>

As you discuss with your doctor medications you can ask the following questions:<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>What is the difference between different treatments: hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the appointment of bisphosphonates, the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators? Which of them will be most effective it is for me?</li>
	<li>Should I use HRT? If yes, what are the risk factors in terms of other diseases, such as cardio-vascular system?</li>
	<li>How do I know that therapy is effective?</li>
</ul>
If we are talking about a particular medication, ask the following questions:<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>What is this medicine?</li>
	<li>How does it work?</li>
	<li>Who should not take it?</li>
	<li>What facts should inform the doctor before and during use of the drug? For example, can be critically important pregnancy or pregnancy planning. Many drugs can not be used during <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> because they can damage the fetus. Also very important are the following facts and conditions:<br><br>
- You are <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/mammalogy/breast-feeding.html">breastfeeding</a> or plan to breastfeed. Many drugs enter the breast milk and may harm the baby.<br>
- You have a chronic disease of the liver, kidneys, cardiovascular system, high blood pressure<br>
- You are allergic to any medications<br>
- In the past you have had serious problems with the gastrointestinal tract<br>
- Any allergies, surgery and serious illness, you have had in the past<br>
- List all medications you are taking now or plan to take, even those that are sold without a prescription, and you seem to be quite safe (vitamins, nutritional supplements, etc.)<br>
- Tell your doctor if in the course of treatment you are having symptoms such as stomach pain, indigestion, difficulty swallowing, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/constipation.html">constipation</a>, bloating, flatulence, nausea, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/diarrhea.html">diarrhea</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headache</a>, aching joints.</li><br>
	<li>How to take the medicine: an empty stomach or with food, drinking water, etc.?</li>
	<li>How long should I take the medicine?</li>
	<li>Can I take the medicine with other drugs?</li>
	<li>What are the possible side effects of medication?</li>
	<li>What other measures should be taken, except for the use of drugs to reduce fracture risk?</li>
	<li>How much is a drug?</li>
</ul>
