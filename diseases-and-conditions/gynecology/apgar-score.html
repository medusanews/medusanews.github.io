  This first evaluation, which is a child. Every newborn expose it in the first minutes of life.<br><br> Use the Apgar score doctors indicate the degree of asphyxia - as far as he is hit by a sharp lack of oxygen during birth. And, accordingly, understand what actions to reanimate the baby they should take.<br><br> Condition newborn is estimated to be at least twice: at the end of the first minute to the end of life and fifth.<br><br> The first estimate - not a prediction of further development of the child. It only indicates the amount of assistance that you need as soon as possible to have a baby. But the second estimate, if it is low, may already be a harbinger of health problems. Such a child should in the first year of life observed by a neurologist, my mom will have to adhere to doctor's appointments - for example, spend more courses of massage, medical gymnastics...<br><br> Evaluate the five indicators on a scale from 0 to 2 points, their summed, the result that we obtain an estimate from 0 to 10 points.<br><br> The first measure - the number of heartbeats. The heartbeat is absent - 0 points. The heart rate below 100 beats per minute - 1 point. More than 100 - 2 points.<br><br> The second indicator - the presence of spontaneous breathing. The baby is not breathing - 0 points. Irregular single breaths - 1 point. Breathe regularly and independently - 2 points.<br><br> The third indicator is very important - the color of the skin. He says that violated circulation or not, and whether the child lacks oxygen. The baby was born completely white or blue - 0 points. Taurus pink and blue hands and feet - 1 point. Entirely pink - 2 points.<br><br> The fourth indicator - reflex irritability. This is not a test of reflexes neurologist, as some think, a response to suction mucus from the mouth. If this procedure does not react to the baby - 0 points. If the person appears pout - 1 point. If shouting - 2 points. Also watch the response to touch, to rub.<br><br> And the fifth indicator - muscle tone. It is determined by eye. If the kid is completely spread-eagled, straight arms and legs are spread apart - 0 points. If the arms and legs bent at - 1 point. But when the baby is curled into a ball, knees and elbows bent, it's good - 2 points.<br><br> Of course, there is a more objective measures of the child immediately after birth - for example, the oxygen tension in the cord blood. But for this we need to do a special analysis. And then the naked eye can fairly accurately assess the condition of the child - so Apgar score and midwives are all over the world.<br><br> 10 points in the first minute rarely gets.<br><br> Typically, babies are born with blue hands and feet. Normal score - 8.<br><br> 7 - border state with him a lot depends on how the child adapts to new conditions. Score below seven indicates that the baby should immediately help. If this is done quickly, the second estimate will be higher, and this is a good prognosis for the future.<br><br> Apgar scores are entered into the extract for children's hospitals, which is handed out. So that evaluation can be read there. The entire first year doctors will ask my mother for what Apgar scores her baby was born. Children who have experienced the birth of a strong lack of oxygen will, of course, require more medical attention.
<h2>Who Invented scale?</h2>
Apgar has created an American anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar. First female professor in history at Columbia University, the first female head of department of anesthesia, it is in the middle of the twentieth century was to learn how to feel the babies immediately after birth.
