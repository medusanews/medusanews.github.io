  <h2>General</h2>
Menopause - is the period when menstruation stops. Average age at menopause woman 51 years old, but it may occur as before and after between 40 and 55 years. Menopause is a normal stage of aging, every woman carries it on his own. Some do not notice any significant changes in the body or in mind, others are uncomfortable and do not tolerate this stage of their lives.
<h2>Menopause Reasons</h2>
Somewhere in the 35 years of a woman's ovaries begin to change the number of produced estrogen, a hormone necessary for menstruation and <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a>. With age, estrogen becomes less and less. As long as the menstrual period ceases and the woman will lose their reproductive function. Changes in the level of estrogen in women affecting many organs, including the heart, bone, genito-urinary tract, skin, hair.
<h2>The symptoms of menopause</h2>
Hormonal disorders that occur before and after the menopause, have different symptoms. Menopause symptoms may include: irregular cycles, hot flushes, vaginal dryness, urinary system problems, mood changes, and a bad dream.<br><br> The menstrual cycle becomes irregular before the onset of menopause. The cycle may become longer or shorter, the allocation may be stronger or weaker than before. Spotting may be in the middle of the cycle and.<br><br> Tides - that feeling when the heat starts growing waves in the chest and spreads to the neck, face and hands. Hot flashes occur on average once every hour and usually last 3-4 minutes. Hot flashes are often replaced by a significant sweating and then chills, and they can occur at any time, even at night during sleep (called night sweats). Three out of four women experience hot flashes during menopause, but only one of these four hot flashes can last for over 5 years.<br><br> Dry vagina may result in reduced levels of estrogen in the body. With a shortage of estrogen vaginal wall loses its elasticity, becomes thinner and generate less secret. Dry or tight vagina can cause discomfort during sexual intercourse.<br><br> Urinary incontinence is also evolving due to low levels of estrogen in the body, which reduces the muscle tone of the urinary tract.<br><br> Variability of mood and poor sleep may occur both before and after menopause. Scientific studies argue in favor of a direct relationship between low hormone levels and <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/depression.html">depression</a>, irritability, fatigue, sleep problems, etc., the symptoms that are commonly experienced by women during menopause.
<h2>What you can do?</h2>
Eat a healthy diet. Proper nutrition contributes greatly to the overall health of the person. During menopause diet should contain a variety of fruits, vegetables and grains. Choose foods low in fat, try to eat dairy products at least 3 times a day. If you do not drink milk, take calcium (1000 mg) of vitamin D (400 IU) every day. Moderate alcohol and caffeine.<br><br> Engage in physical activity (at least half an hour a day), try to lead an active lifestyle, this will help reduce hot flushes and is the prevention of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/endocrinology/osteoporosis.html">osteoporosis</a>. Longer walk, you walk, use the stairs, even if there is an elevator. Try to dress up with the expectation that you are always able to partially undress upon the occurrence of high tide.<br><br> From vaginal dryness, use water-soluble lubricants (lubricants), but not petroleum jelly.<br> In pharmacies sold a lot of dietary supplements and herbal products whose manufacturers claim that the use of these products reduce symptoms of menopause. Unfortunately, not all of them have been adequately tested and clinical trials of safety and efficacy. By the same composition and amount of active compound in such products can also differ greatly. Before you buy and start taking these supplements, consult your doctor. Typically, the composition of such products include soy, ginkgo biloba, motherwort, licorice, red clover, plant kava-kava and others. Herbal preparations (as well as any other!)

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>
The doctor will warn you about menopause and will, if necessary hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Since menopause associated with low estrogen hormone replacement that help relieve symptoms. Unlike many of contraceptives, most of the hormones used in HRT are natural, side effects are minimal.<br> HRT should not be used if your close relatives had <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/breast-cancer.html">breast cancer</a> and uterine <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancer</a>.<br> Estrogens may be used in the form of tablets, patches, gels, creams, and suppositories, as well as implants. Estrogens - a necessary component of HRT, if a woman uterus is removed, there is no need to appoint other hormones. If the uterus is retained, it is usually administered more progestins and 14 days of each cycle.
