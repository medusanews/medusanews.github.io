  In the history of gynecology was a time when doctors believed that after <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/childbirth.html" title="Childbirth">childbirth</a> the uterus is no longer needed by the body, and even increase the risk of gynecological diseases. Therefore, for any problems "below the belt" body that in many ways makes a woman a woman, without further doubt was removed: no uterus - no problem.<br><br> TRUTH ABOUT UTERUS<br><br> But the problem is not slow to appear: have operated on women <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/menopause.html" title="Menopause">menopause</a> occurs on average 5 years earlier, and therefore earlier announced themselves of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/heart-disease.html" title="Heart Disease">heart disease</a> and <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/endocrinology/osteoporosis.html">osteoporosis</a>.<br><br> So now from the "preventive" removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) refused, and the doctors are fighting for the diseased organ to the end. But sometimes, all funds have been exhausted and the removal of the uterus - the only solution?
<h2>If you remove the uterus</h2>
Many women believe destroy perfectly protected and hidden in the depths of the pelvic muscular organ that during childbirth exerts a force comparable to the thrust of the car in first gear may only some quite terrible disease. In fact it is not. Here they are mortal enemies of the uterus.<br><br> Fibroids are large. In this disease, the body size is increased as in <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a>. And kogdamiomavyrastaet more "12 weeks", the uterus should be removed.<br><br> <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/Endometriosis.html" title="Endometriosis">Endometriosis</a> - the expansion of the inner layer of the endometrium. Possible at any age, it provoked <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortions</a> and other gynecological surgery. The main danger is that endometriosis can spread to other organs: vagina, ovaries, bladder, rectum.<br><br> Treatment of long courses of expensive drugs does not always help.<br><br> <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cervical-cancer.html">Cervical cancer</a> occurs in women of all ages, including even the virgins. Scientists are increasingly inclined to believe that this form of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancer</a> linked to the human papilloma virus, which is transmitted through sexual contact. The disease can be easily detected by physical examination and successfully cured in the early stages, but in advanced cases of hysterectomy - the only way out.<br><br> Uterine cancer develops mainly between 40 and 50 years. Symptoms vary: weight loss, weakness, pain, and <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">bleeding</a>. The most radical method of treatment - removal of the uterus.
<h2>HOW THE TRANSACTION</h2>
Women who undergo an operation, care about many issues. Where to go? How will the intervention? What to expect after him?<br><br> Hysterectomy operations can be divided into open and endoscopic, but they are performed under general anesthesia. On the advantages and disadvantages of each judge. Just remember that in some cases, endoscopic surgery is not possible.
<h3>Type of surgery</h3>
Section<br> Length<br> Dates<br> Benefits<br> Disadvantages
<h3>Where to spend</h3>
Open incision 4-6 cm (horizontal or vertical) from 40 minutes to 2 hours In a day you can get up, after 10 days written out cheaply, reliably remains seam; longest period of recovery in the gynecological department of any city hospital<br> No Endoscopic incision, only three holes of not more than 1 cm from 1.5 to 3.5 hours of the evening you can get up to 5-6-day - home No seam easier to bear surgery is expensive, less reliable: sometimes in the process of intervention have to switch to open surgery in the major research centers and institutes.
<h3>How to live</h3>
Behind the operation, life slowly returns to the groove... But this process interfere with heavy thoughts: to tell whether such a delicate operation on her husband? What will happen to the body, forcibly deprived of the uterus, in 2-3 years? And most importantly - has remained a woman a woman, if she can hope for love and happiness?<br><br> The same questions once asked experts and obstetrics and gynecology clinics of V. F. Snegiryov MMA behalf IM M. Sechenov. They conducted psychological testing of women who have had a hysterectomy - and that's what the results were.<br> It turns out that before the operation 80% of women are seriously thinking about the consequences. 39% were not afraid of her, of the remaining 61% quarter was afraid of death, 18% - of complications, 9% - a broken relationship with her husband, 6% - lack of results, 3% - early aging and the same thought about the "cosmetic" side of the issue. <br><br> The vast majority - 94% of women - after surgery found that the fears were not realized. One-third of women who have experienced self-doubt, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/depression.html">depression</a>. But 38% felt that their quality of life improved significantly after surgery, and 16% even harmonize relations in the family! And basically it was the patients who did not hide the fact from their husbands operations.<br><br> The majority of the operated relationships with their husbands remained flat, with only one in ten said the deterioration of family relationships.
<h2>FINAL CHOICE</h2>
So, you need to make a choice, and the choice difficult. Psychologists in such cases are advised to take a piece of paper in half and raschertit in two columns bring the pros and cons of possible solutions. We can help you with this. Here are the pros and cons of a hysterectomy is often called a woman who had undergone this operation.
<h2>Cons</h2>
Psychological discomfort<br> The seam in the lower abdomen<br> Pelvic pain for several months after surgery<br> Limitation sexual few months after surgery<br> Inability to have children<br> Menopause occurs on average 5 years earlier<br> Risk of osteoporosis and <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/heart-disease.html" title="Heart Disease">heart disease</a> at a younger age.
<h2>Pros</h2>
No menstruation (saving on the pads)<br> You can not get pregnant, you can not think about birth control during sex<br> There is no pain and bleeding that were symptoms of the disease and tortured before surgery<br> Do not need to be treated for diseases of the uterus, can not be afraid of her cancer diseases<br> Reduce belly and weight (for example, the uterus with multiple fibroids can weigh a few pounds.)<br> Of course, the drawbacks of hysterectomy is much more serious than the pros. However, it would be strange if there had been it differently. But if the operation is inevitable, it is important to understand: the tragedy happened.
