  <h2>General</h2>
If you suddenly discovered that passionately wanted a sandwich with butter, or burst into tears with emotion at the sight of a small child, or you want the pain to buy a pair of earrings that you are unlikely to wear, stop a while and ask yourself how soon you begin monthly. If soon, your unusual behavior may be caused by premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual tension syndrome (PMS). This specific condition which precedes menstruation and in varying degrees is typical of most women. When it&#8217;s PMS, just try to calm down and control their actions. When will the month, you will return to its normal state.<br><br> Premenstrual tension syndrome is associated with the consequent fluctuations in hormone levels in the blood.<br><br> Before premenstrual syndrome viewed as a psychological disorder until researchers have proven that this state has an organic nature, due to changes in hormone levels in the body.<br><br> For example, the decline in estrogen and progesterone levels are:<br><br> - To increase production of aldosterone, which causes a lot of changes in the body<br> - To raise the level of monoamine oxidase (substances released in the tissues of the brain and could cause a <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/depression.html">depression</a>)<br> - Reduce the level of serotonin (a substance that is released into the tissues of the brain and affects the activity level and mood).<br><br> For some women, PMS is calm, others very rapidly, but the time of onset of symptoms is always predictable. It allows to distinguish the premenstrual tension syndrome from other diseases. Changes in the emotional and physical condition appear 7-10 days before menstruation, and are almost immediately after the start of menstruation. These dates can be set if for a few months to keep a diary of menstruation, noting therein all the symptoms and the start and end of month.<br> If the symptoms persist throughout the menstrual cycle, the ICP may not cause them. In this case, you should see a psychiatrist.
<h2>Causes of premenstrual syndrome</h2>
The appearance of premenstrual tension syndrome in some women, and its absence in others due primarily to fluctuations in hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle and individual reactions to them the whole organism. Recently, however, scientists have begun to investigate other possible causes of this condition (no definitive proof)<br><br> - Monthly cyclical fluctuations in the amount of certain substances (neurotransmitters) in the brain, which include endorphins that affect mood<br> - Malnutrition: symptoms such as premenstrual syndrome, mood swings, fluid retention, breast tenderness, fatigue associated with a deficiency of vitamin B6, while <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headache</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/dizziness.html">dizziness</a>, palpitations, and a craving for chocolate caused by a deficiency of magnesium<br> - A hereditary factor. It is proved that identical twins are much more likely to suffer PMS together than fraternal. Perhaps in the ICP there is a genetic predisposition.
<h2>The symptoms of premenstrual syndrome</h2>
<h3>The physical symptoms</h3>
- Hypersensitivity or breast tenderness,<br> - Breast augmentation<br> - Fluid retention in the body, leading to swelling of the feet and hands and a weight gain of about 2 kg<br> - Headaches, particularly migraine<br> - Nausea, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a>, and dizziness<br> - A <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/pain-in-the-muscles.html">pain in the muscles</a> and joints and specific <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/back-pain.html">back pain</a><br> - In some cases, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/constipation.html">constipation</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/diarrhea.html">diarrhea</a><br> - Excessive thirst and frequent urination<br> - The craving for food, especially salty or sweet, intolerance to alcohol,<br> - Lethargy, tiredness, or vice versa, energy,<br> - Palpitations and flushing,<br> - Increasing the number of acne.
<h3>Psychological symptoms</h3>
- Frequent changes of mood<br> - Depression, melancholy, a sense of depression,<br> - Constant tension and irritability<br> - <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/insomnia.html">Insomnia</a> or prolonged sleep<br> - Distraction and forgetfulness.<br> Some women may experience more severe symptoms<br> - Panic<br> - Thoughts of suicide<br> - Aggressiveness, propensity to violence.
<h2>What you can do?</h2>
- Exercise. The study showed that regular exercise reduces the symptoms of PMS, perhaps? this is due to the release of endorphins or other substances in the brain that relieve <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a> and improve mood.<br><br> - Sleep for 8-9 hours a day. Lack of sleep exacerbates anxiety and other negative emotions, increases irritability. If you suffer from insomnia, find a way to deal with it. Deep breathing and other simple ways to relax before going to bed are often very effective. Before going to bed, take a hot tub and drink a glass of warm milk.<br><br> - Stick to a diet low in fat and a high percentage of fiber. During PMS try to eat as little as possible products such as coffee, cheese and chocolate. With their use associated with the appearance of migraines and many other symptoms of PMS such as anxiety, frequent mood swings and heart palpitations.<br><br> - Do not eat a lot, limit sweets, better take some fruit.<br><br> - Maintain a constant level of insulin in the blood for this little eat about 6 times a day, it is better than to eat a large portion of time. Try to eat right.<br><br> - Nutritionists recommend a daily basis in the form of dietary supplements use vitamin B6 (50-100 mg) and magnesium (250 mg). In addition, doctors prescribe calcium supplementation, which, together with magnesium relieve the symptoms of PMS and protects against <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/endocrinology/osteoporosis.html">osteoporosis</a>, and iron (to combat anemia).<br><br> - Many women say that they are helped primrose oil (a substance rich in essential fatty acids). Talk to your doctor about the dosage for you.<br><br> - Stay away from the crowds of people, without the need not to go out on the street if there is bad weather, and eat as much vitamin C (an antioxidant and an immune system stimulant). Women who suffer from PMS, get sick more often. Scientists believe that this is a consequence of weakening of the immune system before the start of menstruation, which makes the body vulnerable to viral, bacterial and fungal infections.
<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>
Since the causes of the disease are not yet clear, the treatment focuses on alleviating PMS symptoms thereof:<br><br> - With anxiety, insomnia and other psychological symptoms, your doctor may prescribe tranquilizers or sedatives. However, prolonged use of these drugs is not desirable because they are addictive. Newer antidepressants have shown to be effective for PMS, but they must be taken under the supervision of a physician.<br><br> - For migraines associated with PMS, your doctor may prescribe a special therapy aimed at preventing headaches. For pain relief, most doctors prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen.<br><br> - Swelling, or other signs of fluid retention prescribe diuretics, which should start to take 5-7 days before menstruation.<br><br> - In some cases, your doctor may prescribe progesterone for PMS and other hormones.
<h2>Prevention of PMS</h2>
Any disturbance in the body, the causes of which are unclear, difficult to prevent. To date, the best way to control this situation is the ability to cope with it, not prevention.
