  <h2>General</h2>
Postpartum period includes the time from the birth of the placenta until the regression of changes in the body during <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a>. This period of 6 weeks. In most cases, it is going well, but sometimes there are dangerous complications requiring emergency treatment.
<h2>Changes in women after childbirth</h2>
Immediately after birth the placenta uterus begins to contract and after a few minutes takes a rounded shape. The wall of the uterus becomes thick and gaping vessels of placental site are compressed. After only 2 weeks of its dimensions correspond to non-pregnant uterus. Within a few days after birth the surface layer of the uterine lining are exfoliated and released in the form of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">bleeding</a>.

Typically, the milk comes to an end 3, beginning 4 days after birth. Mammary glands to harden for several hours, increasing in volume, become painful, the temperature rises.
