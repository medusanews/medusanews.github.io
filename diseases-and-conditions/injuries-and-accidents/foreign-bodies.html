  <h2>Overview</h2>

As a rule, foreign bodies get into your eyes, ears, nose, respiratory tract and rectum. Problems with the ingestion of foreign bodies occur in both children and adults. Children are naturally curious and can therefore deliberately put in your mouth shiny objects such as coins or tablet batteries. For this reason, these objects are very often get in their ears and nose. As for adults, but in this case, a person may accidentally swallow the inedible object or inhale any foreign body that gets stuck in his throat. Even if the subject for example, such as a toothpick successfully passes the esophagus and into the stomach, it can become lodged in the rectum. In addition, the eyes often get carried by wind, small objects and it can happen to anyone regardless of age. Foreign bodies are found in hollow organs (like swallowed batteries) and in tissues (such as a bullet).<br><br>

Some of them are safely inside your body, while others cause irritation and other reactions. In the latter case, foreign bodies can cause scarring or inflammation. Such items may be infected or cause of infection and successfully defend it from the action of the immune system of your body. Foreign bodies may block the channels as a result of its size, and due to irritation and wounds, they can cause. Some of them can be toxic.

<h2>The reasons</h2>

Foreign body in the eye: the eye can get airborne substances such as dust, dirt, sand, etc. More serious damage can be caused by a hard sharp object penetrated the eye, and found themselves inside the cornea of ??the eye or the connective (the mucous membrane covering the inner surface century). Ears and nose are often put their child objects in the nose, ears and other hole. Beans, corn popcorn, raisins, beads this is just a small part of what can be found in the cavities of the body. Sometimes it happens that in the ears or nose can fly insect.

<h2>Symptoms, foreign body sensation</h2>

Foreign body in the eye: swelling, redness, discharge of blood from the surface of blood vessels, sensitivity to light, sudden vision problems.<br><br>

Foreign body in the ears and nose pain, hearing loss, a feeling stuck in your ear the subject, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">bleeding</a> from the unpleasant smell from their nostrils.<br><br>

Foreign body in the respiratory tract and stomach: difficulty swallowing, salivation, respiratory failure.<br><br>

Foreign body in the rectum: a sharp burning pain during defecation.<br><br>

Other symptoms vary depending on the size of the object, its location, time spent in the body.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

Foreign body in the eye: before you do anything, the victim should be placed in a well lit area where it would be easier to detect foreign object. Hands should be washed thoroughly. You can touch the eye, using only clean, preferably sterile materials. If the object is small, it can be removed several times batting or raising the upper eyelid and covering their underwear, blowing or washing their foreign particles. For these purposes, you can also use a piece of clean cloth. After that, the eye should be washed with clean warm water or special ophthalmic solution. In other cases, the patient must show an ophthalmologist.<br><br>

Foreign body in the ears to remove the foreign body from the ear, use a tweezers. To remove an insect in the ear canal pour warm (not hot) liquid paraffin, olive oil, or any child.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

Foreign body in the eye: to detect a foreign object into the eye of a physician directs a beam of bright light and uses a special eye drops. Many items can be successfully removed using a surgical forceps. Often the doctor prescribes antibiotics, sterile ointments. If the foreign body penetrated into deeper layers of the eye, the surgeon will need counseling in ophthalmology for the purpose of emergency care.<br><br>

Foreign body in the ears and the nose: The items are deeply penetrated into the ear canal is much more difficult to remove, as this could damage the eardrum. These cases require immediate intervention of a qualified physician.<br>
Foreign body in the airways and in the stomach when the object hit deep into the respiratory tract, may use a bronchoscope (a special tool for visual studies airway and eliminate interference.) In other cases, for example, if an object is blocking the entrance to the stomach - can be applied to a fiber-optic endoscope (an instrument with backlight to examine internal body cavities). Typically, the doctor gives the patient a soothing and relieve throat. After that the foreign object can either pull or push the stomach, depending on whether it can, according to the doctor yourself to go through the digestive tract. Small objects in the digestive organs, causing no irritation and no sharp edges, can independently exit the body through the action of the excretory system. Sterile objects that do not cause any symptoms, can also be left in the body. Surgery to remove the foreign body is necessary if the object causes the appearance of any symptoms.<br><br>

Foreign body in the rectum: rectal retractor helps to remove items that a doctor discovered during a medical examination. To eliminate objects, deeply penetrated into the rectum, may require surgical intervention.

<h2>Preventive measures</h2>

Parents and grandparents need to ensure the safety of small children, always making sure that suitable batteries were stored in an inaccessible place, and used promptly fell into the garbage and not a place where curious children can find them easily. To minimize the likelihood of food particles in the respiratory system of children, parents should forbid them to eat on the go or during play. Adults also should chew or talk during the meal. As for eye injury, many of these cases can be avoided by putting in the work safety glasses.
