  <h2>Overview</h2>

Cystitis is an inflammation of the bladder. It usually appears along with urethritis (inflammation of the urethra). The bladder body sac, which collects urine produced by the kidneys. In his two ureters drain through which urine flows from the kidneys, and urethra of urine from the bladder out of the body surface. For accurate diagnosis the doctor will need analysis of your urine. This analysis is done to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the species of bacteria, the causative agent (to prescribe the most appropriate antibiotic).

<h2>How to pass a urine test</h2>

Rinse the tip of the penis or vagina with warm water (or you may be asked to wipe this area disinfectant). Women should wash first front and then behind. A small amount of urine into the toilet drain, stop and then a small amount of urine, fill the jar for analysis (about four teaspoons), stop again, and then pour the rest into the toilet. You need to collect midstream urine. Do not touch the jar for analysis from the inside.

<h2>Causes of cystitis</h2>

Usually the cause of cystitis are trapped in the bladder through the urethra bacteria. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli (E. coli), normally detectable in the rectum, although other bacteria or disease can also cause cystitis.<br><br>

Based on the anatomy of the body, women and girls are more prone to cystitis than men. In women, the urethra is shorter and located closer to the anus, respectively, the infection is easier to penetrate into the bladder.<br><br>

Another cause of cystitis may be an inflammation of the urethra after sexual intercourse. This is caused by prolonged friction urethral opening, which may occur during sexual intercourse. Symptoms usually develop within 12 hours after intercourse.<br><br>

Symptoms of cystitis may also cause irritation of the external opening of the urethra. Some people, for example, there is an <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/allergology/allergy.html" title="Allergy">Allergy</a> to vaginal deodorants, perfumes, soap and talcum powder, even a color toilet paper.<br>
Sometimes cystitis ill children. In some cases this is caused by anatomical abnormalities, when the urine is thrown back into the ureters and the flow of urine through the excretory system is broken. A child with symptoms of cystitis required medical examination.<br><br>

Elderly or disabled people who find it difficult to move, may also suffer from cystitis. The reason is not completely empty the bladder, or rare urination.<br>
Children and adults who suffer too long before the act of urinating, the most prone to cystitis. In rare cases, the cystitis may be caused by a tumor.

<h2>Symptoms of cystitis</h2>

In adults, cystitis usually causes frequent and painful urination. The nature of pain is described as a burning sensation. The urine may smell strongly, to be troubled with blood. This may worsen mood and feel constant pain in the lumbar region.<br>
In older children and symptoms are often not so obvious. The only symptoms may well be a <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/abdominal-pain.html">abdominal pain</a>, nausea.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

Drink at least 10-14 glasses of fluid a day. Drink less tea, coffee and completely eliminate alcohol. These drinks cause irritation of the bladder.<br>
Limit your intake of foods containing high levels of calcium (only during treatment). These products include milk, cheese and yogurt.<br><br>

To ease the pain between her legs lay on his stomach or back a warm object such as a bottle of warm water or a bag of millet heated.<br><br>

Every three hours drink a glass of water in which baking soda is dissolved. This reduces the acidity of the urine and eliminates burning.<br><br>

Unfortunately, cystitis can cause very serious complications, the infection can spread upward through the kidneys.<br><br>

Should seek emergency medical attention if:<br><br>

- Symptoms during the day does not pass (because the infection can spread to the kidneys);<br>
- Have a fever, pain in lower back, blood in urine;<br>
- These symptoms occur during <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> (pregnant women are more susceptible to infections of the kidneys);<br>
- The disease recurs;<br>
- The disease appears when changing sexual partners;<br>
- The disease manifested itself in a child or a man.<br><br>

If you suffer recurrent urinary tract infections, you should refer to the urologist. Take prescribed medications (usually antibiotics and pain relievers) is strictly as directed by your doctor. Do not interrupt treatment.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

You may need tests to check the status of the bladder, urethra and kidneys. Doctor will prescribe the appropriate treatment. In some cases you may need surgery.

<h2>Preventive measures</h2>

Empty your bladder as often as you need it. This is especially important because control of urination is one of the main causes of cystitis.<br>

Drink at least eight glasses of fluid a day.<br>

Wash at least once a day. After urination, women should first wash the front, then back to reduce the likelihood of bacteria from the anus to the urethra.<br><br>

Prefer cotton underwear and avoid synthetic wearing tight pants.<br><br>

If r is repeated cystitis (recurs), you should replace bathing in the shower. The usual shower or a bidet much easier cleaning the.<br><br>

After intercourse, take a urine. At the same bacteria, trapped in the urethral opening, wash before they begin to multiply.
