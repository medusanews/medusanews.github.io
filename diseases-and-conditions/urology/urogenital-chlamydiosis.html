  Urogenital chlamydia is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis is currently the most common disease transmitted through sexual contact. Chlamydial infection is found in several times more frequently than gonorrhea, is much more difficult to treat, sometimes associated with other diseases, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/sexually-transmitted-diseases.html">sexually transmitted diseases</a> (gonorrhea, trichomonas, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/herpes-skin-and-mucous-membranes.html">herpes</a> simplex virus, etc.).<br><br>

Pathogen Chlamydia - Chlamydia trachomatis - a unique microorganism. Chlamydia lives inside a living cell, like a virus, but their structure is more like bacteria. This is its dual nature, as well as the ability of a parasite within the cells and is the reason that detect and treat chlamydia is extremely difficult. The intracellular life cycle of chlamydia continued 24-72 hours, after which the infected cell is destroyed and the intercellular space gets &#8220;team&#8221; of young organisms that infect more and more cells.

<h2>The causes of the disease</h2>

Infection with chlamydia is usually sexually transmitted, but the transfer does not occur in all cases: if the gonorrhea from a patient partner will be infected through sexual contact 3 of 4 people, chlamydia 1 out of 4. All that matters is sex of any kind: vaginal, oral or anal. Women are more susceptible to chlamydia.<br>
It is also possible to contact and household transmission.<br><br>

Children can be infected with chlamydia while passing through an infected birth canal, as well as in utero.<br><br>

The incubation period (time from infection to onset of symptoms) is 2-3 weeks.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

Patients may complain of urethral discharge (men), vagina (females), white, yellow or transparent. From the normal secretions may differ odor or yellowish tint. Sometimes there is pain, burning during urination or intercourse, redness and itching at the external opening of the urethra.<br><br>

With the development of complications, patients complain of pain in the perineum, scrotum, rectum, women concerned about <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/abdominal-pain.html">pain in the abdomen</a>, in the lumbar region.<br><br>

Chlamydia is different from many other sexually transmitted infections in that it affects not only the genitals, and lower parts of the urinary system. The clinical picture is often subclinical, the disease can be asymptomatic for a long time and diagnosed only when complications develop.

<h2>Diagnosis</h2>

If you think you have chlamydia or other sexually transmitted infections, should be as quickly as possible to see a doctor (chlamydia in men treated with urologists, gynecologists in women).<br><br>

Diagnosis of chlamydia is difficult because intracellular parasite Chlamydia trachomatis. For testing, depending on the method of investigation can become a scraping from the mucous, blood, urine and semen in men. At present there is an opportunity to identify the pathogen itself or antibodies to it in the blood. Your doctor will advise you the most appropriate method of investigation.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

If you have found chlamydial infection should be encouraged to your sex partner tested. Explain to him / her that the infection may be asymptomatic and do not give any clinical manifestations. Unfortunately, maintaining constant contact with the infection can lead to reinfection and treatment failure. During the treatment of sexual contacts should abstain or use condoms.

<h2>What will help the doctor?</h2>

In the treatment of chlamydial infection is currently used antibiotics from the macrolide, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones. The choice of antibiotic depends on the severity of infection. Do not self. Only a doctor can correctly pick the drug.<br><br>

After completing the full course of treatment you may be advised to pass a second examination to confirm the cure. Typically, this blood is examined by ELISA or PCR.

<h2>Complications</h2>

In men, the most common complication is inflammation of the epididymis <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/urology/orchitis-and-epididymitis.html">epididymitis</a>. In women, inflammatory disease of the uterus and appendages.<br><br>

It should be understood that the presence of chronic inflammation in the organs responsible for genital function, can cause the development of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/infertility.html" title="Infertility">infertility</a> in men and women, lead to the development of various pathological <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> (missed <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a>, premature birth, fetal abnormality). That is why it is so important, in time for treatment.

<h2>Prophylaxis</h2>

The basis for the prevention of chlamydia is the rejection of promiscuity. Condom use is not in all cases to prevent infection.<br>
It is important to inform their sexual partners about the disease, even if they do not care, and to persuade them to undergo examination and treatment of chlamydia. Remember that asymptomatic does not reduce the risk of complications.
