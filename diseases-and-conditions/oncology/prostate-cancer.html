  <h2>Overview</h2>

Cancer of the prostate gland commonly occurs in people older than age 45-55 years, young people is a rare neoplasm. According to statistics, the incidence of prostate cancer in Russia reaches 4.5%, while among the main causes of death Prostate <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancer</a> is the 5th place among men aged 70 years and on the 4th of men 70 years or older. A cancerous tumor grows slowly, and the disease may not manifest themselves for many years. But even a small tumor in some cases it may begin to spread to other organs (metastasis often fall into the bone - pelvis, hip, spine, and in the lungs, liver, adrenal glands).

<h2>The reasons</h2>

The causes of the disease may not be established. However, at present known to some of the factors that increase the likelihood of developing this disease. The risk of disease increases with age. According to some reports increased consumption of foods high in animal fat increases the risk of several of the disease, as well as inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables. Regular physical activity while maintaining normal weight can reduce the risk of prostate cancer. The presence of close relatives of prostate cancer increases the risk of developing prostate cancer. There are also suggestions that vasectomy increases the risk of several cancers of the prostate. Found that the development of prostate cancer associated with hormonal changes in older men (in particular, high - testosterone male sex hormone). Tumor growth is stimulated by testosterone, therefore, men with higher levels of testosterone in the blood of prostate cancer is more likely with more severe disease course.

<h2>Symptoms of Prostate Cancer</h2>

Unfortunately, the symptoms appear only when the disease has gone too far. These include frequent urination, perineal pain, blood in urine and in semen.<br><br>

In some cases the first manifestations of the disease may be symptoms associated with bone metastases (bone pain, chest) or signs of toxicity (dramatic weight loss, weakness, pale skin, with an earthy flavor).

<h2>Complications:</h2>

- Acute urinary retention;<br>
- <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/fractures.html">Fractures</a> of the bones.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

All men over age 50 should do an annual test to determine blood PSA (prostate-specific antigen), the number is in the blood increases dramatically with the development of malignant tumors of the prostate. It should be noted that at present it is practically the only way to detect the disease at an early stage when it can still be removed.<br><br>

It is a once a year to contact the urologist for a checkup, make sure the study includes the finger of the prostate through the rectum.<br><br>

If you or your loved ones suggest prostate cancer, you should carefully consider all the recommendations of a physician. If you are assigned to therapy, keep in mind the need for regular medication. All you have any questions arising must discuss with your doctor.<br><br>

When the side effects should seek immediate medical attention. This will help to quickly take the necessary steps and expedite recovery.<br><br>

You need to live a healthy lifestyle. When fatigue should be enough to relax.<br><br>

After the end of therapy requires constant supervision required, including the PSA, a study through the rectum and <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/ultrasound-examination.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> examination. This is essential to detect possible complications or tumor recurrence.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

Urologist necessarily carries digital rectal examination, ultrasound and X-ray study to better define tumor size and condition of other organs. The final diagnosis is made after the results of prostate biopsy (a small piece of tissue examined glands, obtained using a special needle through the perineum or rectum).<br><br>

Doctor prescribes therapy, which, depending on the stage of the disease can be surgically (removal of the prostate), medical and radiotherapy.<br><br>

If successful, the operation in the early stages of the disease we can talk about complete recovery.<br><br>

Modern medicine has developed various methods of drug therapy (primarily hormonal). Hormonal drugs can reduce the rate of tumor growth and metastasis.<br><br>

<a href="/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/radiation-therapy.html">Radiation therapy</a> is the irradiation of the prostate with radioactive radiation. In some cases, radiation and drug therapy are used together.<br><br>

Such combination therapy does not cure, but it improves the condition of the patient and reduces the symptoms of the disease.

<h2>Prevention of prostate cancer</h2>

Many risk factors for this disease can not be changed. However, one should take into account the general recommendations for the prevention of cancer. Recommend to eat more variety of plant foods (fruits and vegetables receive 5 times a day or more) and to limit foods high in animal fats. To useful products also include wholemeal bread, cereals and grain products, rice, pasta and bakery products.<br><br>

Maintain a healthy lifestyle.<br><br>

If you smoke, quit the habit.<br><br>

Moderate drink alcohol.<br><br>

Exercise regularly and keep yourself in good physical shape. Monitor your weight.<br><br>

If your close relatives have been cases of prostate cancer, then you need to 45 times a year to do a <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/blood-test-total.html" title="Blood test (total)">blood test</a> for PSA and consult a urologist about the results of the analysis. Be sure to keep all the results of your tests. In some cases, even to the increase of PSA values (although within the limits of normal) may require additional inspections.
