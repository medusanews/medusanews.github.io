  <h2>Overview</h2>

Lung cancer - a malignancy that develops from the epithelial tissue of the lung. There are two forms: a central cell lung cancer that comes from the bronchus, and peripheral <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancer</a> that develops from within the lung tissue.<br><br>

Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers. Despite all the efforts for its prevention, the incidence of early XX century, grew up in a few dozen times. Lung cancer in many countries leading in causes of death from cancer among men. First of all, this is due to the fact that the initial stages of lung cancer occur almost asymptomatic, and patients go to the doctor too late.

<h2>The causes of the disease</h2>

The cause of any malignant disease is damage to cellular DNA, which occurs under the influence of various environmental factors. In the case of lung cancer such factors may be smoking, work in hazardous industries, inhalation of different pitches, cokes, esters and other harmful substances. The increased incidence of lung cancer in miners, workers staliliteynoy, woodworking, metallurgy, ceramic asbestos and phosphate production.<br><br>

According to statistics, lung cancer of smokers there were significantly more likely than non-smokers. The explanation of this fact is quite simple. Tobacco smoke contains both physical and chemical factors of carcinogenesis in large quantities. About 80% of patients with this pathology smokers. Lung cancer may be preceded by chronic inflammation: chronic <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/pneumonia.html">pneumonia</a>, bronchiectasis, chronic <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/bronchitis.html">bronchitis</a>, scarring in the lung after previously suffering a TB, etc.

<h2>Symptoms of Lung Cancer</h2>

- Cough;<br>
- Shortness of breath;<br>
- <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/pain-in-the-chest.html">Pain in the chest</a>;<br>
- Coughing up blood;<br>
- Loss of body weight.<br><br>

Unfortunately, the symptoms of lung cancer are non-specific, ie characteristic of many respiratory diseases. That is why patients do not seek medical attention immediately, and diagnosis in many cases it is not timely. Identification of most of these symptoms should alert and get immediate medical attention. You also need to pay attention to such indirect signs as lethargy, listlessness, loss of proper activity. We need to pay attention to the little wanton increase in body temperature. A small temperature can mask the lung by sluggish bronchitis or pneumonia.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

If you or a person close to you diagnosed with lung cancer should begin treatment immediately and act in accordance with the recommendations of a physician. What would have been tempting offers, try not to resort to self-healing techniques and alternative medicine.<br><br>

With more than 15% of the initial stages of lung cancer occur completely asymptomatic, and therefore suspect its presence is through the annual survey dispensary. In Russia, such a survey is an annual snapshot of photofluorographic or rentgenogoramma. If a picture is revealed tumor shadow in the picture, the diagnosis of &#8220;lung cancer&#8221; is not removed until it is proven otherwise. For further diagnosis of lung cancer can be used the following methods:<br><br>

- Computerized tomography;<br>
- Bronchoscopy;<br>
- Transthoracic puncture;<br>
- Biopsy of lymph nodes;<br>
- Determine the level of  <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/tumor-markers.html" title="Tumor markers">tumor marker</a> s in the blood.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

Depending on the type and stage of lung cancer oncologist assigns the required treatment program. Applied surgical treatment, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/radiation-therapy.html">radiation therapy</a> and chemotherapy. None of these methods is not equivalent, and, as a rule, they are appointed in a combination.<br><br>

The prognosis for lung cancer depends primarily on the stage of the process on which it is diagnosed, as well as the histology of the tumor.<br><br>

Lung cancer can metastasize to the lymph nodes of the root of the lung, mediastinum, and the more distant groups in the neck, supraclavicular region. Also lung cancer can spread to the liver, bone, brain, and the second lung.

<h2>Prevention of Lung Cancer</h2>

For preventative measures include timely and appropriate treatment of various inflammatory processes in the bronchi and lungs in order to prevent their transition to the chronic form. It is very important preventive measure is to stop smoking. Working in hazardous industries with high dust levels should use the methods of personal protection in the form of masks, respirators, etc.
