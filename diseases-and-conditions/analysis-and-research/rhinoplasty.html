  Correction of the nose (rhinoplasty) is of interest not only to those who do not like the shape of the nose. With this surgical method - rhinoplasty - you can restore or improve breathing.<br><h2> FNL - Spout - conk</h2> Rhinoplasty is performed not only on subjective but also on objective grounds. These include a variety of deformation of the nose caused by an accident, as well as birth defects (such as cleft palate, and upper lip or hypoplasia of nasal bones).<br><br> But most patients are turning to cosmetic surgery for correction. Basically commitment to excellence engulfed the fair sex, men usually come to the clinic with complaints of shortness of breath and <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/otolaryngology/snoring.html">snoring</a>, the fault which deviated septum.<br><br> Fortunately, at the time of rhinoplasty can simultaneously solve both problems. Alas, sometimes the opposite is happening: after the ill-conceived action to correct the shape of the nose may suffer breathing. Therefore, the planning and pre-preparation for rhinoplasty should be given much attention. In addition to the standard set of tests and procedures to be safe and consult an ENT doctor is sometimes required to conduct a <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/computed-tomography.html" title="Computed tomography">CT</a> scan, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/x-rays.html" title="X-rays">X-rays</a> of the sinuses, Rhinomanometry (the study of nasal breathing).<br><br> Contraindications for rhinoplasty: serious internal diseases, diabetes, clotting disorders, mental disorders. The operation will have to wait for inflammatory diseases and cold. Correction of the nose is not carried out to people younger than 16 years, since before this age are still growing and the formation of bone and cartilage tissues. With the exception of post-traumatic strain and birth defects.<br><h2> Rhinoplasty come up with the Indians</h2> In India, there was a cruel custom to cut off their noses prisoner of war. "Clipped" did everything to bring back the lost. To help the unfortunate Indian doctors have come up with an interesting operation. From the center of the forehead flap is cut out of the affected skin and deploying it to 180 degrees, cicatrize on the vacancy. Then wooden tubes were doing in the new nose nostrils. The British arrived in India, were stunned by the Indians in rhinoplasty and appropriated the original technology. In 1814, a British military doctor first in Europe modeled his patient a new nose.<br><h2> New nose... out of his ears</h2> Technology rhinoplasty different. To the nose, "potatoes" do fine aristocratic nose, it is necessary to remove excess soft tissue and change the position of a cartilage. Sometimes partially removed cartilage, bone tissue and excess skin. If there is a small hump sawed off a protruding portion of the bone. Eliminate the curvature correction of nasal septum. Refine your nostrils too wide by removing the portion of the base of the nose. If you need to lift the back of his deeds, then use silicone implants or cartilage ear of the patient.<br><br> Rhinoplasty is performed open and closed methods. Closed way - submucosal resection - is carried out through the nostrils. This method of rhinoplasty faster - it takes about 40 minutes. However, in this case, the surgeon performs the work blindly, and when the patient runs the risk of a possible bug to get atrophy of the mucosa, and then atrophic rhinitis, so most surgeons do not venture to carry out the operation in such a way.<br><br> In an open rhinoplasty incision under the nose and the rise of tissue. So the surgeon to work much more convenient. The scar left after rhinoplasty is almost imperceptible.<br><br> Fix the curvature of the nose by using extracorporeal septoplasty: nasal septum is removed, and the doctor corrects her. Then, ready, she cometh in place.<br><br> From the "potato" can be thin aristocratic nose.<br><br> After any operation on a patient's nose a plaster bandage, which will have to carry 7-10 days. Pain during the rehabilitation period is not the case, but a couple of weeks under the eyes will show off the bruises and swelling. Invisible to others, but uncomfortable for the patient's nasal swelling will continue for several months. The first time in the cold shiny new olfactory organ is a different color from the general tone of the face, so it is best to carry out the operation in the spring or early fall. The final shape of the nose will get only half a year, sometimes - one year after the surgery.<br><br> Nature, rewarding us by some external dignity, rarely wrong. It is therefore not surprising that, according to world statistics 30% of patients are satisfied with the results of rhinoplasty, even if the correction of the nose was performed flawlessly. Think about whether to drastically change their appearance. Perhaps it is this "bad" in your opinion, the nose is your unique flavor.
