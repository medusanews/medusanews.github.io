  Due endoscopy treatment of many diseases have become less intimidating and more successful. And most importantly, it is now possible without a scalpel.<br><h2> Introspective</h2> The term "endoscopy" is derived from the Greek words "endon" - "inside" and "skopeo" - "look", "explore. With the help of flexible tubes, equipped with lighting and optical systems that can look into the internal organs. This allows time to recognize even the most minor violations.<br><br> No <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/ultrasound-examination.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> or <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/x-rays.html" title="X-rays">X-rays</a> do not give such detailed and error-free results, as endoscopy.<br><br> Endoscope - the device is 1.5 m long - at one end is provided with a handle by which it is run by a doctor, the other - a lens that serves the "eyes" of the doctor in the depths of the inner world. Located within the endoscope instrument channel through which the lumen of the organ under investigation conducted tiny "cutters" or loop. They can be on the team surgeon opened and closed, pinching off a piece of the mucous membrane.<br><br> Endoscopy is widely used in pulmonology, urology, gynecology, gastroenterology. In this way examine the esophagus (esophagoscopy), stomach (gastroscopy), duodenum (duodenoscopy) and colon (colonoscopy). The endoscope allows not only to consider in detail the inner world of the body, but also to do a biopsy - to take on the analysis of a piece of affected tissue in order to assess whether the warning signs of a serious illness. If the dangerous transformation of cells will be detected at an early stage, then with a terrible illness is quite real deal, including using an endoscope.<br><br> Analysis of the fragment of the mucous membrane is also required in order to establish the degree of internal organ damage bacteria. For example, when a stomach ulcer he helps the doctor in a timely manner to resolve the question of the appointment of antibacterial drugs and their proper combination and dosage. Biopsy - a procedure quite comfortable for the patient, because the mucosa has no pain receptors. Slight <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/sore-throat.html">sore throat</a> after <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/gastroscopy.html" title="Gastroscopy">gastroscopy</a> and transient bloating after colonoscopy - that's all "horror".<br><h2> Surgery without a large incision</h2> Unfortunately, sometimes in time to prevent the disease does not work, and then there is the need for surgery. Today, traditional abdominal surgery minimally invasive techniques are replaced under which injured tissue is minimal, and the patient does not feel pain almost.<br><br> Minimally invasive surgery more often than not more expensive than conventional abdominal.<br><br> Endoscopic intervention is carried out through the mouth (if you operate the esophagus, stomach, duodenum), or through the anus (if the problem lies in the large intestine). A <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/laparoscopy.html" title="Laparoscopy">laparoscopy</a> is still necessary to make tiny incisions in the body, which are administered through the optical apparatus and instruments. After such an operation period of rehabilitation for the patient is getting shorter by 1.5-2 times. A lesser extent, applies anesthesia. No long and rough scars - many times less risk of possible infection and inflammation. Yes, and adhesions after laparoscopic surgery are much less.<br><br> ZOOM AND STAPLES<br><br> Recently, endoscopes with high-definition image so that the image will not yield on the plasma screen. Modern devices are able to zoom in 125 or even 1400 times, allowing the internal organs of a person can be considered as if under a microscope. This is the cellular diagnostics, able to timely detect malignant pathology, and thus prevent the tragic outcome of the disease.<br><br> Endoscopy narrow range allows you to get a complete and informative picture - to see the mucous membrane in the infrared. Actively developing ultrasound endoscopy. If conventional apparatus showing only the mucosa, the device generates an ultrasonic wave sensor penetrating the depth of the examined organ, and outputs the monitor image and submucosal and muscular and serous layer and even tissue structures outside the body.<br><br> Among the latest therapeutic endoscopic techniques - argon plasma coagulation, through which professionals to effectively stop the internal <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">bleeding</a>. Another novelty - endoclipping method (surgeon closes the mucosal defects clasps).<br><br> PROGRESS DO NOT STOP!<br><br> Today, about 70-80% of all diseases of the gastrointestinal tract can be cured with the help of Endosurgery, and only 20-30% remain on traditional operations. As a rule, do not give in endoscopic techniques only the most neglected diseases.<br><br> MOVIE ABOUT STOMACH<br><br> For those who do not want to push a long slippery "hose", provides an alternative to more pleasant - capsule endoscopy. Its use in the study of the esophagus and the small intestine. The patient need only swallow a small plastic capsule equipped with a special micro-camcorder, micro-transmitters, antenna and batteries, designed for 8 hours.<br><br> One-time capsule capable of producing over 50,000 color images with 2 photos per second, which are transmitted to a special device fixed on the patient's belt. The camera provides high quality images, and, as a consequence, - the ability to more precisely define the diagnosis.<br><br> The patient swallows the capsule, and it goes all the way that each day passes absorbed by the food.<br><br> The process does not cause any pain or discomfort. Pending the results can lead normal life - to walk, eat, read on... Do not just fitness and hard physical work.<br><br> To explain the results, the doctor you want to see more pictures 50000. By viewing in movie mode (24 frames per second) it takes 1.5-2 hours. Then all the information and conclusions are printed on the form.<br><br> Contraindications for examination by videocapsule bit: plight of the patient, intestinal obstruction, the presence of an artificial cardiac pacemaker. Preparation for the procedure also reduces to a minimum; the last time you need to eat for 15-16 hours before the start of the study.<br><br> Capsule endoscopy can help find the cause of recurrent or permanent ailments, such as <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/abdominal-pain.html">abdominal pain</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/diarrhea.html">diarrhea</a>, bleeding or anemia in cases when other diagnostic methods are powerless.
