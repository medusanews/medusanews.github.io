Gonorrhea may become infected newborns while passing through the birth canal, with a few days after birth appear yellow purulent discharge from the eyes.<br><br> Genital herpes is a highly contagious viral disease that is transmitted by sexual contact and enters the body through the cracks in the skin. The causative agent of the disease is the second type of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/herpes-skin-and-mucous-membranes.html">herpes</a> virus.

For pregnant women, it is very important to cure herpes before <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/childbirth.html" title="Childbirth">childbirth</a>, because the virus can be transmitted to the child during the passage through the birth canal.

At this stage, there are serious complications, such as <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/stroke.html">stroke</a>, heart abnormalities, mental illness. This damage to the body, may be serious enough to cause death.<br><br> Trichomoniasis is a bacterial infection transmitted through sexual contact.
