  <h2>General</h2>
If you notice that your skin is colored in yellow, and the sclera - the shell of the eyeballs - become yellow, you may have jaundice. Jaundice is not a separate disease, but rather a condition that indicates that the body is something wrong and you need medical supervision. Yellow staining of the skin and sclera prevents the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment and an intermediate natural destruction of erythrocytes in the liver.<br><br> Normally bilirubin is mixed with the contents of the digestive system and excreted from the body. However, if it is not fully displayed, it is abnormal accumulation, which indicates the presence of infection, blockage of the bile ducts or other problems with the liver. It also causes jaundice, increased breakdown of red blood cells, designated by the term hemolytic anemia. The reasons for this are quite a few types of anemia, including a variety of disease and taking certain drugs.<br> Blockage of bile ducts is usually due to the presence of gallstones that block the flow of bile from the liver and gall bladder. To this can also cause infections and tumors. Also lead to jaundice, liver disease, such as infections, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancers</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/chronic-hepatitis.html">chronic hepatitis</a> related to alcohol abuse.
<h2>Causes of jaundice</h2>
Biochemical substrate bilirubin released when spleen decomposes erythrocytes. Further bilirubin transported to the liver where it is metabolized so that it can be derived from an organism. If any of the steps of this process have difficulties bilirubin accumulates in the body and thus makes the skin yellow.<br><br> The most common causes that lead to jaundice: <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/hepatitis.html">hepatitis</a> viral etiology, cirrhosis (usually in <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/alcoholism.html">alcoholism</a> or due to chronic hepatitis), gallstones, hemolytic anemia, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/malaria.html">malaria</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/yellow-fever.html">yellow fever</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/syphilis.html">syphilis</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/hodgkins-disease.html">Hodgkin&#8217;s disease</a> (lymphoma), the immaturity of the liver in infants (may also be due to infection from the mother), cancer pancreas or bile duct, liver metastases.
<h2>The symptoms of jaundice</h2>
The sclera and skin turn yellow. Urine becomes dark brown in color and can resemble tea. White, pale unpainted chair. <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">Fever</a>, chills. Pain in the right upper abdomen. Loss of appetite and / or weight.
<h2>Complications</h2>
Newborn Jaundice usually disappears after a few days. Sometimes the inability to excrete bilirubin can lead to anemia, and anemia in turn leads to reduced blood supply to the tissues of oxygen. The end result of this process is stunted physical and mental development.
<h2>What you can do?</h2>
Reduce the risk of jaundice can be if you do not eat at restaurants or other eating places, the purity of which is in doubt, as well as the use of a condom during sex with a partner who may have been infected with hepatitis. Consult your doctor if you have one, let alone a few signs of jaundice, and if you are being treated with intravenous injections, and you feel that your skin and sclera become yellow, and if the last time you performed a blood transfusion, and you will have yellowing skin.<br><br> Take your medications as prescribed by your doctor and inform him or her of any changes or worsening of your condition. Make sure that all the doctor&#8217;s instructions were carried out. You should also be aware that the treatment may vary depending on the cause of jaundice. When you feel better, the yellow color of the skin may fade.
<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>
It is recommended to see a doctor as soon as possible. Jaundice can be treated in different ways depending on the cause. The doctor may prescribe you a <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/blood-test-total.html" title="Blood test (total)">blood test</a> to evaluate the function of the liver, a liver biopsy to make and even make a special irradiation to determine the cause of jaundice and select the optimal treatment strategy. Treatment includes administration of drugs, surgery, depending on the cause of jaundice. Recently, widespread endoscopic, non-surgical treatments for obstructive jaundice etiology. Babies can be recommended phototherapy. The child is placed under the fluorescent lamp on one or two days. During this time, the liver matures to independently process bilirubin. When using phototherapy bilirubin is destroyed and removed from the body. Sometimes it can be caused by neonatal jaundice bile duct atresia (absence of the lumen).
