  <h2>General</h2>
Infected drinks and food are the main cause of many problems c digestive system. Gastrointestinal diseases associated with impaired health standards, are most common in the third world countries and in remote areas of Russia. Most of the cases of Traveler&#8217;s diarrhea caused by hitting a variety of infectious agents in the intestine. This advantageously bacteria. The local population is repeatedly exposed to these agents in childhood, so they develop immunity to it.
<h2>Causes diarrhea</h2>

<h2>Diarrhea symptoms</h2>
Typical symptoms of traveler&#8217;s diarrhea include: liquid and frequent stools (<a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/diarrhea.html">diarrhea</a>), nausea, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/abdominal-pain.html">abdominal pain</a> and cramps.

It is desirable to have in your medicine cabinet hiking bags for preparation of such a solution, for example, touring or Regidron.<br><br> Need urgent medical attention if:<br><br> - The child&#8217;s blood in the stool, moderate or severe dehydration, temperature above 38.5 degrees or constant <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a><br> - Diarrhea in infants;<br>- Diarrhea in pregnant or people with serious chronic health problems (such as cardio-vascular system).<br><br> Adult people should contact your doctor if diarrhea persists for several days, and if there is blood in the stool, with a significant increase in body temperature or chill, or when there is no opportunity to make up the reserve fluid in the body and the risk of dehydration.
<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

By unsafe products are unpasteurized dairy products, salads, raw meat, fish and seafood, as well as food bought on the street.<br><br> Among the safest beverages include boiled water (including tea and coffee), drinks, packaged in bottles or cans, beer and wine. And in the category of dangerous drinks include tap water and drinks prepared with ice. When you brush your teeth, do not use tap water. By drinking water from a bottle or a can wipe the neck.
