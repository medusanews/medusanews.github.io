  <h2>General information about the disease</h2>

Chickenpox - a contagious infectious disease in children occurs in a fairly easy manner, infants, adults, and people with weakened immune disease can take a much more severe. Chickenpox is usually transmitted by airborne droplets. After contact with the patient can take 10 to 21 days before symptoms appear. A person can infect others without even knowing that he was ill. The infectious period starts in a couple of days before the characteristic rash on the skin and lasts as long as the new abscesses stop appearing and old ones will be covered with a crust.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

Symptoms of chickenpox begin to appear with shivering, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/abdominal-pain.html">abdominal pain</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headache</a> and general malaise. For a couple of days earlier on the body can get a rash. The heat may be stronger in the first days after the onset of rash (small, itchy, red spots on the face, head, shoulders, chest and back). Also, a rash may appear in the mouth, on the eyelids and in the genital area. In this case, one patient may be only a few boils, and the other will be covered by them all. At first it with bright red marks blisters. They quickly disappear and tightened crust, which, in turn, dies within 2 weeks. In the first 4-5 days continue to emerge sores and blisters can occur at the same time so all the stages of skin rashes.

<h2>Complications of chickenpox</h2>

Typically, a person is sick with chickenpox once in a lifetime. However, the immune system is stored in a virus that can not manifested, and then activated again in adulthood, causing a rash. Such a rash called shingles or <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/herpes-skin-and-mucous-membranes.html">herpes</a> zoster.<br><br>

Chickenpox can permanently leave pockmarks on the skin, especially in adolescents. Temporary marks may remain visible from 6 months to a year.<br><br>

If a pregnant woman gets sick Chickenpox a few days before giving birth, the newborn may get a severe form of the disease.<br><br>

Chickenpox can lead to serious secondary bacterial infections, viral <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/pneumonia.html">pneumonia</a> (infection of the lungs caused by certain viruses and accompanied by symptoms of fever, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/cough.html">cough</a> and shortness of breath), encephalitis. Encephalitis is a viral disease of the brain, is a very rare complication of chickenpox. However, it is important to know the symptoms: fever, confusion, forgetfulness, fatigue, sharp pains, extending to the limbs (lumbago). In identifying similar symptoms should immediately take the patient to the doctor.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

Should seek immediate medical attention. In severe general condition and severe skin manifestations may require hospitalization, especially when symptoms of the nervous system (pain radiating to the leg, severe headache), or if the patient becomes difficult to breathe. Drink plenty of cool fluids. Paracetamol can help reduce fever.<br><br>

Do not use acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Ulcers in the mouth stick to a sparing diet. Avoid eating salty foods, and citrus fruits and juices.<br><br>

For painful and itchy rashes in the external genitalia can be used for external use drugs with analgesic effect. When choosing best to consult with your doctor or pharmacist.<br><br>

If signs of abscess formation in situ lesions can use antibacterial ointment.<br><br>

You must re-ask the doctor if the temperature is above 38 degrees is held over 4 days.<br><br>

Children do not have to stay in bed, but must be in a state of rest. When the body temperature drops, and pockmarks covered with a crust, the child can walk. The issue of attending school, kindergarten or nursery decided by your doctor. Attempts to strip cover with healing pocks can lead to reinfection and further itching. It is recommended to cut nails short and wash hands frequently to prevent infection, overnight wear cotton gloves to reduce the risk to tear pockmarks during sleep.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

The doctor will prescribe antiviral drugs adult patients (children usually need a rest and rest). To be most effective, treatment should be initiated as early as possible, as soon as a rash (at least 24-48 hours). When re-infection the doctor will prescribe antibiotics and identify early complications have arisen.

<h2>Prevention of chickenpox</h2>

If you there is a high probability of getting sick with chickenpox, see your doctor. Prescription medications or vaccination can prevent infection. Avoid contact with other people during the infectious period (until all the pockmarks not heal crust). If people were likely infected by contact with you, advise them to watch for the possible appearance of skin rash within 2 weeks after exposure. Virtually impossible to prevent the spread of the disease in the same family. Studies show that 9 out of 10-spouse (s) of an infected also sick.

<h2>Vaccination is recommended for children from chickenpox after year</h2>

Be sure to consult your doctor if you have had contact with the patient, and you have not had chickenpox as a child, especially at lower immunity, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> or if you have had surgery for bone marrow transplant
