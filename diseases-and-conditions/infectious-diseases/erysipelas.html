  <h2>What is the erysipelas?</h2>
Rozsa or erysipelas - a serious infectious disease, which is the external manifestations of progressive damage (inflammation) of the skin.<br> Word erysipelas comes from the French word rouge, which means red.<br> Of prevalence in the present structure of infectious diseases erysipelas is the 4th place - after acute respiratory and intestinal infections, viral <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/hepatitis.html">hepatitis</a>, most often recorded in the older age groups. 20 to 30 years suffer erysipelas mostly men, whose professional activity is connected with frequent micro-traumas and contamination of the skin, as well as sudden changes in temperature. It's drivers, porters, construction workers, military, etc. In the older age group, most of the sick woman. Erysipelas usually appears on the hands and feet, sometimes on the face, even more rarely on the trunk, in the crotch and on the genitals. All of these are well marked inflammation around and causing the patient a feeling of acute psychological discomfort.
<h2>Cause of the disease</h2>
The cause penetration of streptococci through damaged with scratches, bruises, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/cuts-and-abrasions.html">abrasions</a>, intertrigo, etc.<br><br> About 15% of people can be carriers of this bacterium, but not ill. Because for the development of the disease requires that the patient's life were also identified risk factors or predisposing disease.
<h2>Aggravating factors</h2>
- The integrity of the skin (abrasions, scratches, injections, scrapes, scratches, chafing, cracks)<br> - Extreme changes in temperature (hypothermia as well as overheating)<br> - <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">Stress</a>;<br> - Sun exposure (sunburn)<br> - Bruises, injuries.<br><br> Very often arises because of the erysipelas predisposing medical conditions: foot fungus, diabetes, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/alcoholism.html">alcoholism</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="Obesity">obesity</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/vascular-disease/varicose-veins.html">varicose veins</a>, lymphostasis (problems with the lymphatic vessels), foci of chronic streptococcal infection (erysipelas person tonsillitis, otitis, sinusitis, dental <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/stomatology/caries.html">caries</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/stomatology/periodontal-disease-and-parodontitis.html">periodontal disease</a>, limb thrombosis in erysipelas, sores), chronic systemic diseases that reduce the overall immunity (usually in the elderly).<br><br> Streptococci are widespread in nature, are relatively resistant to environmental conditions. Sporadic increases in the incidence observed in the summer-autumn period<br> The source of infection in this case are both sick and healthy carriers.
<h2>The features characteristic of erysipelas</h2>
The disease begins with the appearance of acute <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a>, general weakness, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headache</a>, muscle pain, in some cases - nausea and <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a>, increased heart rate, and body temperature rises to 39,0-40,00 C, in severe cases, there may be <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/convulsions.html">convulsions</a>, delirium , irritation of the meninges. 12-24 hours from the time the disease join the local manifestations of the disease - pain, redness, swelling, burning and tension of the affected area of the skin. The local process in erysipelas can be placed on the skin of the face, trunk, extremities, and in some cases - in the mucous membranes.<br><br> When erythematous erysipelas affected skin is characterized by redness (erythema), swelling and soreness. Erythema has a uniformly bright color, clear boundaries, a tendency to peripheral distribution and rises above the skin. Its edges irregular (as chipping "flames" or other configurations). In a subsequent on-site erythema may appear flaky skin.<br><br> Erythematous-bullous disease begins in the same way as erythematous. However, after 1-3 days from the time the disease is on-site erythema detachment of the top layer of the skin and form bubbles of various sizes, filled with transparent content. Subsequently, the bubbles burst and form in their place a brown crust. After the rejection of their tender young skin is visible. In some cases, the bubbles appear on the site erosion that can transform into sores.<br><br> Erythematous-hemorrhagic erysipelas occurs with the same manifestations as erythematous. However, in these cases, the background of erythema appear <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">bleeding</a> in the affected areas of skin.<br><br> Bullosa hemorrhagic erysipelas has almost the same display as erythematous-bullous disease. The only difference is that in the course of the disease produced on-site erythema bubbles filled not transparent, and hemorrhagic (bloody) content.<br><br> Easy erysipelas is characterized by short-term (within 1-3 days), relatively low (up to 39.0) body temperature, moderate intoxication (weakness, lethargy), and erythematous skin lesions one area. Moderate erysipelas being a relatively long (4-5 day) and high (up to 40.0) body temperature, severe intoxication (sudden weakness, severe headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, etc.) with an extensive erythematous, erythematous- bullous, erythematous-hemorrhagic lesions of large areas of skin.<br><br> Of recurrent erysipelas is considered that occurred within 2 years after the initial disease on the former site of the lesion. Re erysipelas occurring in more than 2 years after the last of the disease.<br><br> Recurrent erysipelas formed after undergoing primary faces as a result of defective treatment, the presence of adverse comorbidities (varicose veins, fungal infections, diabetes, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/otolaryngology/chronic-tonsillitis.html">chronic tonsillitis</a>, sinusitis, etc.), development of immune deficiency.
<h2>Complications</h2>
In the absence of treatment, a patient threatening complications of the kidney and the cardiovascular system (rheumatic fever, nephritis, myocarditis), but there may be specific to faces: ulcers, and skin necrosis, abscesses and cellulitis, impaired lymph circulation, leading to elephantiasis.
<h2>Forecast</h2>
Weather favorable. If you frequently recurrent erysipelas may elephantiasis, breaking disabled.
<h2>Prevention of erysipelas</h2>
Warning leg injuries and abrasions, treatment of diseases caused by streptococcus is.<br><br> Frequent relapses (more than 3 per year) in 90% of cases are due to underlying disease. Therefore, the best prevention of the second and subsequent comings faces is to treat the underlying disease.<br><br> But there is also drug prevention. For patients who are regularly tortured erysipelas, there are special antibiotics prolonged.<br> (Slow) actions that prevent Streptococcus multiply in the body.
