  <h2>Overview</h2>

People suffering from bulimia have a tendency to react to stressful situations, nervously consuming large amounts of food. The triggering factor may have different negative emotions, such as a failure, a failure in anything, failure, rejection by society, loneliness, anger, or vice versa, positive, for example, a promotion, a celebration of something or the prospect of a new relationship with the opposite sex. To ease your anxiety, suffering from bulimia are beginning to have unrestricted, swallow food without chewing, as quickly as possible. To avoid <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="Obesity">obesity</a>, and feeling ashamed of his behavior at the end of &#8220;orgies&#8221; they resort to one or another way of cleansing the stomach, causing an artificial host <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a> or taking laxatives and diuretics. Others use excessive exercise or intermittent fasting.<br><br>

People suffering from bulimia, to identify more complex than in patients with anorexia or overeating, because they often maintain a normal weight and apparently do not differ from healthy people.<br>
Thus, in contrast to anorexia, which control every step, these patients are not subject to any control: they tend to use drugs and alcohol as excessive, as they too consume food. Sometimes they exhibit other stereotypical behaviors such as obsessive desire for petty theft in stores. Among patients with bulimia increased risk of suicide.

- Heredity.

<h2>Symptoms of Bulimia</h2>

- <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/dehydration.html">Dehydration</a>;<br>
- Scratches on one or more fingers, which puts the patient&#8217;s throat when you try to induce vomiting;<br>
- Inflammation of the esophagus and the parotid gland due to frequent vomiting;<br>
- An imbalance of electrolytes (minerals and salts), which could be due to cramps and muscle twitching;<br>
- A variety of intestinal disorders (due to excessive use of laxatives);<br>

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

If you find yourself or have someone close to the symptoms of bulimia, be sure to consult a doctor. As already mentioned, the patient is completely unable to control himself, and, consequently, the disease may become quite severe.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

Your doctor will do a survey and study the history of the disease. He may ask about eating habits and exercise the patient. Indeed, patients with bulimia engage in sports and dieting all the time, not losing weight, but if you lose weight and then quickly put on weight again.<br><br>

By identifying the signs of bulimia, the doctor will decide whether in this particular situation, the patient required hospitalization. In most cases of bulimia hospitalization is required.<br>
The patient will be recommended diet therapy, given advice on lifestyle changes. Perhaps the doctor will prescribe anti-depressants.<br><br>

Many patients helps to group psychotherapy. Patients with bulimia are ashamed of insatiable consumption of food and, therefore, feel better, discovering that they are not alone in their behavior.<br><br>

Some doctors use hypnosis to treat or teach the patient self-hypnosis technique that helps to control the desire to eat unlimited food.
It is important that family members of patients also received advice from a physician. They should be able to control the situation, to monitor the behavior of the patient. Otherwise, the problem will only get worse, and the treatment is not useful.

<h2>Preventive measures</h2>

Prevention of bulimia - a healthy psychological climate in the family, a stable and secure environment and raise a healthy self-esteem in children. Do not use food as a way to reward and punishment in children. If your child (especially teens) is going through due to over-completeness and weaknesses of the figure, you need to closely monitor his diet and behavior when eating to avoid missing the development of such diseases, such as bulimia.<br><br>

In order to instill in children the right attitude to drugs, do not use them without a doctor&#8217;s prescription. In this case, the children will understand the seriousness of any medication and will not be subsequently abused drugs.
