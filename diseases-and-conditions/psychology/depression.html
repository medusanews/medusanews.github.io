  <h2>Overview</h2>

Depression is a serious psychological disorder, which often suffer from not only the patient but also his family. Most often, depression develops in the presence of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a> or a traumatic situation for a long time. Often depressive disorders are hidden under the guise of a bad mood, character traits. In order to avoid serious consequences, it is important to understand how and why depression.

<h2>Causes of Depression</h2>

Depressive disorders can occur at any age and in representatives of all social groups. This is due primarily to the fact that the values of contemporary society exerts considerable pressure on the person. People tend to the social well-being, professional success, visual appeal.

<h2>Complications</h2>

Relatives of the patient must understand that depression is a transient state in which it is necessary to provide psychological help, not sinking in with the disease itself. Try to convince the patient that there is no fault of his that he became depressed. However, you can handle this serious condition.

<h2>What can your doctor?</h2> 

Left untreated, depression can last months or even years. The basis of treatment is the use of medication and psychotherapy.<br><br>

Medications to treat depression (antidepressants) are selected individually for each patient and made a long time, for several months. Drug treatment will be successful if the patient strictly adheres to the recommended mode of taking the drugs.<br><br>

The aim of psychotherapy to help people learn to regulate their own emotions. This treatment involves the active participation of the patient, his willingness to talk about their problems. All information received by a physician during a session of psychotherapy, remains a mystery.
