On the other hand, each graft is an integer test for a little gentle child's body. In some cases, children suffer vaccine is not very easy - there may be an allergic reaction or fever. This does not mean that further vaccinations should be abolished. Do not forget to remind the doctor about previous reactions, and he will advise your child in a day or two before the scheduled vaccinations take antihistamines.<br><br> Allergic disease is very common in childhood. This is due to an immature immune system in infants. On any new stimulus such immune system reacts hyperergic (superstrong). Try to introduce new foods gradually, one by one. Then you'll know reliably what was the cause of food allergies. A child with a tendency to allergic reactions must be under the supervision of an allergist.
