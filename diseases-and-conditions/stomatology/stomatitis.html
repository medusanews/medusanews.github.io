  <h2>What is stomatitis?</h2>

Stomatitis - the name combines the diseases of the oral mucosa of various origins and manifestations.<br><br>

Stomatitis may be a separate disease or other complication or manifestation, such as scarlet <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a>, influenza, measles, etc. The most susceptible children.<br><br>

Diseases of the oral mucosa are fairly common, but their correct diagnosis is difficult. This is due to the fact that different diseases, not only oral but also the whole body, can occur with the same symptoms. Diseases of the oral mucosa are united under a common name - stomatitis. If the affected mucosa is not the whole of the mouth, but only a single site - tongue, lip or palate, this is called glossitis, cheilitis, or palatinit respectively.

<h2>The causes of Stomatitis</h2>

The causes of stomatitis can be a variety of factors - those that act directly on the mucous membrane of the mouth (local impact), as well as diseases of the body - a disease of the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, the weakening of the immune defense, allergic reactions, metabolic disorders, and many other.<br><br>

Local participation is associated with a direct factor of trauma, chemical, thermal, radiation exposure, which resulted in the mucous membrane there are redness, erosion, ulcer.<br><br>

Mention should stomatitis arising from dental problems. In this case, the cause is non-patient <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/stomatology/oral-hygiene.html">oral hygiene</a>, heavy dental plaque, broken teeth, oral bacteria overgrowth. In addition, stomatitis may occur for violations in the art dental procedures. They are the cause microtrauma, the use of dissimilar metals in the treatment and prosthetics, exposure to chemicals.

<h2>Symptoms of Stomatitis</h2>

The clinical manifestation of stomatitis is divided into:<br><br>

- Catarrhal;<br>
- Ulcer;<br>
- Aphthous.

<h2>What is the catarrhal stomatitis?</h2>

Catarrhal stomatitis - the most common lesion of the oral mucosa. At the same time the mucous membrane of the mouth becomes swollen, painful, congested, it can be covered with white or yellow. There hypersalivation (increased salivation). There may be <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">bleeding</a> gums, bad smell to emerge from the mouth.

<h2>What is ulcerative stomatitis?</h2>

Ulcerative stomatitis - a more severe illness than the catarrhal, it can develop both independently and be running the catarrhal form.<br><br>

In contrast, catarrhal stomatitis, striking only the surface layer of the mucosa in ulcerative stomatitis affected the entire thickness of the mucosa.<br><br>

Initial symptoms in catarrhal and ulcerative stomatitis are similar, but later in ulcerative stomatitis, the temperature increases up to 37.5 C, weakness, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headache</a>, increased pain, and lymph nodes. Food intake is accompanied by severe pain. When you see these symptoms should seek medical advice.

<h2>What aphthous stomatitis?</h2>

Aphthous stomatitis - is characterized by the appearance of single or multiple ulcers aftoznoznyh on the mucous membrane of the mouth, where the ulcers are large and deep. Aphthae are oval or round shape, with clear boundaries in the form of a narrow red border, and grayish-yellow coating in the center.<br><br>

The disease begins with a general malaise, fever, the appearance of pain in the mouth at the place of the AFL. The treatment of such ulcers are usually quite complex, and after the healing traces remain. Treatment of this disease to deal with the doctor.<br><br>

With a weakened immunity, it may cause infectious stomatitis, which is caused by various microbes that live on the surface of the mucous membranes of the mouth and are in an inactive state as long as the immune system is not weakened.<br><br>

Once you have <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/chickenpox.html">chickenpox</a> stomatitis, the likelihood of recurrence of the disease is very high, although the frequency of these repetitions is extremely variable. If the disease is repeated three or four times a year - a rate can be called typical. Some people, however, disease may become almost chronic - ulcers do not have time to heal, as new.<br><br>

As a rule, first stomatitis ill at the age of 10 to 20 years, and then as they grow older, he repeated less frequently and with less soreness.<br><br>

Stomatitis suffer approximately 20% of the population.<br><br>

There is no evidence that infectious stomatitis.

Broken teeth, broken fillings, or rough, with sharp teeth - all of it immediately should be given "to the wolves," the dentist. Be sure to adjust the prosthesis, and with sharp or hard edges. If braces are installed, the projecting parts and brackets can be covered with a dental wax. Brushing and flossing should gently but thoroughly.<br><br>

As a precaution stomatitis should be a daily brushing. This is especially true for pregnant women and adolescent children.

Treatment of canker sores is only concerned with the doctor.<br><br>

In the case where all measures are taken to treat thrush, and stomatitis still does not pass, you need to look for another cause of stomatitis, which is probably a common disease of the body, detection and treatment which deals only with a doctor.
