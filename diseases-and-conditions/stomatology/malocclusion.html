  <h2>Overview</h2>

Jaws - this type of closure of the teeth. Healthy is the "orthognathic bite", in which the upper teeth slightly overlapping the lower. This type of bite ensures optimal performance of the chewing function. As a result of dysplasia of jaws and dentition may appear different malocclusion: an overly-developed or underdeveloped upper jaw lower, launched lower jaw, teeth, standing in the dentition are not in place. While the child is small, such changes are not always afraid of their parents. Sometimes you can even hear the phrase - "Well, he's so cute!". Then the child gets older there is change in the profile of the person for the worse. Standing crookedly teeth and an ugly smile is not encouraging either parent or child. A person with malocclusion is much harder to brush your teeth, which leads to the formation of tartar, and later development of gum disease.<br><br>

Unfortunately, incorrect bite is not only a violation of the aesthetic. At the wrong interdigitation masticated food is bad and goes into the stomach of inadequately treated, can lead to diseases of the digestive system. In addition, malocclusion can lead to violations of the functions of breathing, swallowing, facial expression, speech, and the development of several diseases of upper respiratory tract.<br><br>

That is why it is necessary to monitor the teething baby and time to contact your dentist.

<h2>Causes of malocclusion</h2>

- The hereditary features of the structure of jaws and teeth in the child's parents;<br>
- Dysplasia and the location of the maxillary bones;<br>
- Bad habits such as thumb sucking, tongue;<br>
- Prolonged use of pacifiers pacifiers;<br>
- The use of bottle nipples with a large hole (hole in the nipple should be small so that the milk flowed only when the correct sucking movements, and a small stream. In this case, the lower jaw of the child will develop properly);<br>
- Chronic diseases of ENT organs in which the child have to constantly breathe through the mouth.

<h2>Diagnosis</h2>

For the first time to show your dentist should have a child under the age of 1 year.<br><br>

If you have any suspicion of malocclusion is when the first eruption of deciduous teeth, as early as possible to see a doctor. Indeed, the smaller the baby the easier it will be incurred to correct the deviation.<br><br>

A dentist who is engaged in correcting the bite is called an orthodontist.<br>

The first consultation with an orthodontist is desirable to pass the age of 3 years, when the bite is formed teeth.<br>

For the diagnosis the doctor may take <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/x-rays.html" title="X-rays">X-rays</a> of the skull and jaw, as well as the removal of casts.

<h2>What can parents do to prevent the formation of malocclusion in the child?</h2>

If <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/mammalogy/breast-feeding.html">breastfeeding</a> a child for any reason can not, you should buy for your baby in a drugstore special nipple on the bottle with a small hole, so that milk is not poured into his mouth. It should also buy a long nipple, as it changes the normal position of the language and pulls her cheeks. Getting fed from a bottle, put the child as well as through breastfeeding. Do not put baby to bed with her head thrown back.<br><br>

The habit of thumb sucking, or bite his lip should be eliminated. Your dentist will tell you what to do, there are techniques. To wean the child from pacifiers to 9 months. When the first teeth, offer your child a little solid food, he is accustomed to working jaws.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

Now there are many ways to correct the bite. The only thing that should be taken into account, referring to the orthodontist this is a lengthy process, which includes not only a competent physician to the robot, but also the daily work of the patient. The reward for work is a beautiful smile and healthy teeth.<br><br>

Previously it was thought that the correction of malocclusion may be conducted only during the formation of dental system, ie in children and adolescents. Currently, there are new designs that allow for orthodontic correction with good results in both children and adults.

<h3>There are several basic methods of treatment of dentoalveolar anomalies:</h3>

- Mioterapiya (a set of systematic exercises similar to the exercise, only to chewing muscles. Mioterapiya is most effective during the period of availability of milk teeth, that is, up to 6 years).<br>
- Treatment with the devices (braces, orthodontic trainers and plates).<br>
- Surgical treatment (surgical correction can fix what was not seen in time as a child, or for the correction of gross genetic pathology).<br>
- An integrated method.<br><br>

Consolidation therapy is conducted in a so-called retention period. It should be twice longer than the active treatment. Only such an approach can fix the result of treatment.
