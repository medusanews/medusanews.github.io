  <h2>Overview</h2>

The term "caries" in Latin meaning "rot" and quite accurately describes the condition of teeth in this disease. Caries is tooth decay, which begins with the dissolution of minerals that make up the tooth, followed by the destruction of hard tooth tissues and the formation of cavities.

<h2>Causes of dental caries</h2>

Demineralization or erosion of minerals that form enamel, occurs under the action of bacteria. As a result of poor <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/stomatology/oral-hygiene.html">oral hygiene</a> on the enamel appears soft plaque. This plaque is closely associated with the surface of a tooth and serves as the focal point of a variety of bacteria. We prove that the tooth does not develop in animals whose bodies are devoid of bacteria, even in cases where these animals are on the cariogenic diet. Absorbing carbohydrates that make up the plaque, the bacteria produce organic acids. Acidic environment promotes the destruction of the apatite crystals, which is part of the enamel, the outer protective shell of the tooth. After that microbes penetrate into the underlying layers and start to destroy them.<br><br>

Of course, the cause of tooth decay is not only the presence of bacteria in the mouth, but also a number of other factors such as heredity. Of great importance is the power. Inadequate intake of protein, vitamins, mineral salts, fluoride, and various trace elements contributes to the development of caries. And the use of large quantities of sweet only helps the bacteria to destroy the teeth. The important role played by the composition and properties of saliva. Found that in people prone to dental caries, saliva more viscous and it changed the ratio of mineral salts.

<h2>Symptoms of tooth decay</h2>

There are several stages of tooth decay.<br><br>

Stage Spot: When viewed from the surface of the tooth revealed a white or dark spot. At this stage, the person usually does not experience any discomfort.<br><br>

The stage surface caries: short-term pain is accompanied by the action of mechanical and thermal stimuli. The enamel becomes rough.<br><br>

The stage of secondary caries: is defined cavity.<br><br>

The stage of deep cavities: the cavity increases. touching or cavity causes pain.

<h2>Complications</h2>

If at the beginning of the disease did not seek medical attention, the process of tooth decay progresses, bacteria penetrate through the dentin to the pulp of the tooth and cause of inflammation of the pulp, which, if untreated, will go into <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/stomatology/periodontitis.html">periodontitis</a>, which can eventually lead to tooth loss and more dangerous complications.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

In order not to miss early signs of tooth decay, you must be at least 1 time a year to visit the dentist. The fact that in the early stages of tooth decay is asymptomatic, and see a little speck of an inexperienced eye itself is quite difficult. We have seen the chewing surface of teeth. A tooth can be placed on the lateral surface.<br><br>

It is important to understand that if the tooth has appeared, then it does not heal on their own and will only improve. That's why if you notice any of these symptoms, you should immediately get to the dentist.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

Your dentist will determine the extent of tooth decay, and select the appropriate method of treatment. In this case, the sooner treatment is started, the better. For the treatment of dental caries in the stage of the spot is enough to remineralization (restoring enough of the mineral) with a special solution. On the surface, middle and deep caries carried out the processing of the cavity, followed by sealing. In most deep caries using drug pads containing calcium hydroxide, which promotes the formation of 'secondary' dentin, ie, can provide additional protection for the integrity of the nerve of the tooth.

<h2>Prevention of dental caries</h2>

Thus, the decay is due to insufficiently careful brushing your teeth, because of the use of sugar-containing foods. The most wrong thing to do is to drink sweet tea and cookies at bedtime, after you've brushed your teeth. Oral bacteria will be delighted by this unexpected gift.<br><br>

Preventing tooth decay is, above all, proper nutrition, hygiene oral care, regular visits to the dentist. Correct oral hygiene includes brushing the teeth 3.5-minute, 2 times a day (after breakfast and after dinner) and then applying for a mouth rinse. Also recommended 1-2 times a year to make your teeth professionally cleaned by a dentist. Your dentist also can make fissure sealing. Fissure is the chewing surfaces of back teeth, consisting of furrows and grooves, for this reason they are poorly cleaned and the most susceptible to caries. These grooves are filled with a special sealing material, resulting in the chewing surface of the tooth becomes more smooth and protected from decay.
