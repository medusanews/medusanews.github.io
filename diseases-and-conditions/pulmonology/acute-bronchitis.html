  <h2>Overview</h2>

Acute bronchitis - an inflammatory disease of the bronchial tubes (bronchi), in which air is supplied from the environment into the lungs.

<h2>The reasons</h2>

Acute bronchitis usually occurs from exposure to the same pathogens that cause <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/colds.html">colds</a> and upper respiratory tract infection.<br><br>

Bronchitis in bronchial mucus secreted. Tiny hairs that normally clean the air, lose their motility in the mucus. If unable to clear the villus flowing air, it increases the effects of irritants on the bronchial tubes. This leads to further increase the secretion of mucus, which causes coughing, characteristic of bronchitis. During the <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/cough.html">cough</a> is usually allocated a viscous, yellow or gray mucus.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

Found that bronchitis often starts as a common cold, and then the disease is &#8220;localized&#8221; in the chest.<br><br>

When inflammation in the cells that line the bronchial tubes, there is increased secretion of viscous mucus, which clogs the airways, which leads to difficulty breathing and causes other characteristic symptoms.<br><br>

The cough occurs in response to the presence of mucus in the bronchi, which must be removed. When bronchitis during cough allocated grayish or pale yellowish sputum. Bronchitis may also be accompanied by pain in the upper half of the chest, which is intensified by coughing.<br><br>

In acute bronchitis are also observed <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a>, wheezing.

<h2>Complications</h2>

For most people, acute bronchitis is not dangerous. However, in smokers, people suffering from asthma and other lung diseases, or who breathe polluted air are often at increased risk of recurrent cases of acute bronchitis with a protracted course and the development of chronic bronchitis.<br><br>

In heart failure with frequent bronchitis dangerous protracted.<br>
If you have a cough, a sputum streaked with blood or greenish color, as soon as possible consult a doctor because they may be symptoms of pneumonia.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

We recommend home treatment, you need to stay warm. Drink herbal infusions and decoctions to liquefy and to facilitate sputum. acetylsalicylic acid or paracetamol can be taken to decrease the general discomfort and reduce fever.<br><br>

Keep the humidity in the room with the humidifier. Breathe warm, moist air, while taking a hot drink. You can steam, which helps to reduce the paroxysmal cough.<br><br>

For the treatment of OTC drugs can be used. Select an expectorant, which improves the sputum. Despite the fact that the cough interferes with sleep, avoid taking antitussives, which reduces coughing, interfere with normal sputum.<br><br>

If self-treatment does not lead to improvement within a few days or if you feel a marked difficulty in breathing, a significant increase in body temperature, then as soon as possible to call a doctor.<br>
In repeated cases of acute bronchitis are also required consulting a doctor because this may be a sign of chronic bronchitis, which can cause irreversible lung damage.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

If breathing is difficult can be assigned bronhorasshiryayuschie drugs. Usually after the inhalation of these drugs is rapid relief of breathing. If a bacterial infection should be treated with antibiotics.<br><br>

If <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/pneumonia.html">pneumonia</a> is suspected prescribed <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/x-rays.html" title="X-rays">x-ray</a> of the chest.<br>
Depending on the type and severity of pneumonia may require hospitalization.<br><br>

In-patient treatment in most cases, bronchitis disappear within 7-10 days.<br>
Diagnosis of acute bronchitis is usually made on the basis of the main symptoms. If you suspect a bacterial infection may require culture of sputum.<br><br>

In most cases, acute bronchitis is itself about a week. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms. Antibiotics are usually not written down until until it is established the nature of bacterial bronchitis. However, antibiotics may be prescribed as a precaution to prevent secondary bacterial infection, if a person suffers from <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/emphysema.html">emphysema</a>, asthma, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/heart-disease.html" title="Heart Disease">heart disease</a> or other such chronic diseases.

- Avoid contact with people who have acute bronchitis or colds;<br>
- If you work with chemicals or other irritants, wear a special mask;<br>
- If you have asthma or respiratory allergies, prevention of acute bronchitis should be discussed with your doctor.
