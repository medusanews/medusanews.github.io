  <h2>Overview</h2>

People usually say they caught the colds, while in reality the common cold sick (Doctors often diagnose acute respiratory virus SARS, or severe respiratory diseases - ARD). And SARS, and incoldsenza caused by viruses. However, the colds - a serious disease that annually causes deaths and respiratory viral infection only rarely causes serious harm to human body.

<h2>The reasons</h2>

SARS causes infectious agents called viruses. They are transmitted by airborne droplets (by inhalation of droplets of sputum, falling in the air by coughing and sneezing of sick people), as well as through contaminated hands, or items such as toys, door handles, fabric.

<h2>Symptoms of SARS</h2>

Incoldsenza usually starts suddenly with high fever, and the condition of people is so often worse, that they immediately try to lie down. SARS symptoms usually appear slowly and are limited to local manifestations in the nasopharynx. When the colds becomes irritated or <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/sore-throat.html">sore throat</a>, dry <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/cough.html">cough</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a> with shivering, sweating, aching muscles and body.<br><br>

SARS symptoms include sneezing, coughing, sore throat, nasal congestion or runny nose. If the body temperature rises, and then sparingly. In most cases, SARS held for 5-7 days, although the cough may persist for 1-2 weeks. Discharge from the nose of green or yellow color indicates that the immune system is actively fighting an infection.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

Help your immune system fight infection. To do this you need to rest and drink plenty of coldsids. Also, avoid inhalation of cigarette smoke.<br><br>

Nasal sprays or drops of salt water will help clear the nose.<br><br>

Inhale steam from any container with hot water (not boiling), wound around the head of the towel. In the water you can add essential oils or brew the leaves of eucalyptus (to remember about possible allergic reactions!).<br><br>

Apply decongestants. They are available as sprays, drops, pills or potions, and can help treat a cold or sinusitis. Check the label to make sure that the drug is safe for use in children, pregnant and lactating women.<br><br>

You can gargle with warm salt water (or with the addition of soda), use lozenges or hard candy for the throat.<br><br>

Painkillers such as paracetamol, ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) can ease the pain. Make sure and read the label or package insert, to ensure the safe in your case using the product.<br><br>

Do not forget that acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is prohibited for use in the age of 18, because it can cause serious harm to the child's body and cause dangerous Reye's syndrome. The only exceptions are cases in which aspirin was appointed by your doctor.v
Before using these drugs should consult with a physician or an employee of the pharmacy. Please note that all medications, including drugs of natural origin, can have side effects and interact with other drugs. In addition, many drugs of natural origin may not be as well tested as a registered medicine.<br><br>

Vitamin C may accelerate recovery from SARS and ease the condition, but does not prevent the progression of the disease.<br><br>

The use of zinc in the treatment of drug does not reduce the duration of the disease and does not help the patient, in addition, these drugs have side effects.
If you have other diseases such as asthma or diabetes, for which may become more severe with SARS, be sure to contact your family doctor. Do the same if your condition suddenly deteriorated and disease is difficult or delayed longer than usual.<br><br>

Be sure to call your doctor if you or your child have any of the following symptoms: temperature higher than 38.5 C, severe <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headache</a>, pain in the eyes of the world, chest pain, shortness of breath, noisy or fast breathing, shortness of breath in, skin rash; pale skin, or the appearance of stains on it; <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a> difficulty waking in the morning or unusual drowsiness; persistent cough or muscle aches.<br><br>

It is urgent to call the doctor if your child develops any of the following symptoms: bulging of the large fontanelle (the soft part of the skull at the top of the head), fever in children younger than 6 months, excessive irritability, unusual cry of a high tone, lethargy, loss of appetite, reluctance to drink; pain in the ear.<br><br>

Antibiotics are detrimental affect only the bacteria and have no effect on viruses. Therefore, antibiotics will not work either with SARS or the colds. Your immune system must deal with these viruses by itself. Antibiotics do not help improve your condition and will not be able to stop the spread of infection. It is important to understand that the use of antibiotics when you do not need them, may make them less effective at the time when they really need. In addition, antibiotics often cause side effects such as stomach upset, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/diarrhea.html">diarrhea</a>, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/stomatology/thrush-in-children-candidiasis.html">thrush</a> and allergic reactions.<br><br>

Infections of the ear and throat are both bacterial and viral. When they are caused by bacteria, treatment is sometimes used antibiotics. Examples of such diseases can serve as <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/otolaryngology/otitis-media.html">otitis media</a> (which can cause severe pain in the ears of children), severe sore throat and sinusitis (causes pain in the face, heaviness in the nose and around the nose, profuse nasal discharge). However, in the treatment of these diseases antibiotics appoint a doctor.

- Sneezing and coughing, cover your mouth;<br>
