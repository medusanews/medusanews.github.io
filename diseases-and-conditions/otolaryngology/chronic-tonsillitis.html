  <h2>General</h2>
Chronic tonsillitis - a chronic inflammation of the tonsils. In this disease, lymphatic tissue in the interior of the tonsils has been a steady presence of bacterial infection that leads to a decrease in the protective function of the tonsils and increase their size. The disease runs with periodic exacerbations in the form of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/otolaryngology/angina.html">angina</a>. Unfortunately, chronic tonsillitis dangerous by the fact that the permanent presence of infection in the body causes decreased immunity, susceptibility to frequent respiratory and other diseases. A marked increase in the amount of the tonsils leads to disruption of breathing, swallowing and voice. That is why chronic tonsillitis in advanced cases is an indication for removal of the tonsils. The disease is more common in children.
<h2>Causes of the disease</h2>
The normal infectious agents must penetrate the amygdala, where will their recognition cells of the immune system and starts a cascade of immune responses aimed at building immunity. After recognition, and "careful study" infectious agents must be destroyed by immune cells (macrophages) right in the thick of tonsils. However, in some cases, the lymphatic tissue does not have time time to defuse the "enemy", and then there is inflammation of the tonsils themselves tonsillitis. Acute tonsillitis (angina) is described in the relevant article. Chronic tonsillitis, usually occurs after suffering angina. In this case, an acute inflammation in the tissues of the tonsils does not undergo complete regression of the inflammatory process continues and becomes chronic.<br><br> In rare cases, chronic tonsillitis begins with no prior angina. The emergence and development of it can contribute to the presence of chronic infection foci as carious teeth, sinusitis, and others.<br><br> In chronic tonsillitis, the tonsils found many combinations of different microbes, some of the most common types of streptococcus and staphylococcus.
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
When viewed from the throat may notice the following symptoms:<br><br> - At the rate of enlargement of the tonsils, tonsil tissue is loose;<br> - Redness and swelling of the palatal arches;<br> - A clump in the lacunae of tonsils "blocks" - off-white curd with odor, sometimes independently isolated from tonsils<br> - <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/stomatology/halitosis-bad-breath.html">Bad breath</a>.<br><br> As a rule, the child are enlarged cervical lymph nodes. There may be a slight rise in body temperature, lasting for weeks and months. The increase in the amount of the tonsils may lead to difficulty swallowing and breathing, changes in voice. Child bothered by frequent <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/angina.html" title="Angina">angina</a> (angina is often considered that arise more frequently than once a year) and SARS.
<h2>Diagnostics</h2>
Diagnosis and treatment of chronic tonsillitis engaged ENT doctor and therapist.<br> After a thorough examination and questioning, the patient may be referred for additional studies (complete blood count, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/blood-test-total.html" title="Blood test (total)">blood test</a> for antibodies to Streptococcus, etc.).
<h2>What you can do?</h2>
If angina occurs with severe pain in the throat and a high temperature, the chronic tonsillitis may show mild symptoms and patients for a long time do not go to the doctor. Meanwhile, chronic infection of the tonsils leads to diseases such as rheumatism, kidney, heart, and a number of others. Therefore, chronic tonsillitis necessarily need to be treated. Try to contact a qualified ENT doctor and follow his recommendations. Chronic tonsillitis can be treated conservatively or surgically. The question of surgical intervention is always solved in conjunction with the child's mother.
<h2>What will the doctor?</h2>
Conservative treatment of chronic tonsillitis in remission is washing to remove the lacunae of tonsils out infected "blocks". During acute tonsillitis, it is important to complete the course of antibiotics. This treatment can eliminate chronic inflammation of the tonsils and reduce the frequency of angina.<br> But often, despite conservative treatment, a chronic inflammation of the tonsils are not saved and restore their protective function. There is the constant focus of streptococcal infection in the tonsils leads to complications, so in that case you need to remove the tonsils. A decision on the need for surgery is taken by the doctor individually for each patient, if conservative treatment possibilities have been exhausted, or if developed complications that threaten the body.
<h3>Remove or not to remove the tonsils?</h3>
For tonsillectomy, there are strict indications that guide the physician in the appointment of the operation. Parents of children, as a rule, are worried that the removal of the tonsils may weaken the child's immune system. After all, the tonsils are one of the main protective gates at the entrance into the body. These fears justified and justifiable. However, it should be understood that in a state of chronic inflammation of the tonsils are not able to perform his job and become a focus of infection in the body. Remember, tonsillitis is a disease that in addition to the heavy flow of its dangerous complications such as abscesses paratonsillar and rheumatic diseases.<br><br> At present there is no evidence of any decline of the immune system after tonsillectomy. It is possible that the function of the tonsils take the tonsils and other lymphoid tissue scattered over the mucous membrane of the throat.<br><br> As a rule, after the removal of the tonsils, the child begins to get sick less often than before.
