  <h2>What is a colon polyp?</h2>
Colon polyps - benign tumor formation growing out of the wall into the lumen of the intestine.<br><br> Polyp - education, rising above the level of the mucous membrane in the form of spherical, mushroom or branching growths, or sitting on a stem, or on a broad basis. Color polyps gray-reddish, sometimes dark red or yellowish, the surface is always covered with mucus, the consistency of soft.<br><br> If the rectum is located a few polyps, suggest polyposis colon.<br> Any polyp should be considered as a precancerous condition. However, long-lived polyp can be transformed into a malignant tumor of colorectal <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancer</a>. Carriers of these tumors can be both children and adults.
<h2>The reasons that lead to colon polyps</h2>
Causes of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/proctology/proctopolypus.html">colon polyps</a> were not significantly clarified. It is unlikely that there are grounds to assert that there is one cause of intestinal polyps and polyposis.<br><br> Polyp almost never develop into healthy tissue. However revealed chronic inflammatory diseases contribute to the aging of the epithelium of the mucous membrane of the colon and the widening of the mucous benign neoplasms. Among the diseases that contribute to the widening of this include ulcerative colitis, enteritis, dysentery, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/typhoid.html">typhoid</a> <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a>, ulcerative proctosigmoiditis. The proof that these pathological conditions of the mucous membrane have been the cause of polypoid growths, is that after the treatment of ulcerative colitis, dysentery or disappear completely and observed polypoid growths. Often the starting point for the development of polyps are <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/constipation.html">constipation</a> and intestinal dyskinesias.<br><br> However, in children is most commonly seen different situation: polyps develop on the background of good health. Therefore, there is another theory of the formation of polyps of the sites that are genetically programmed not the way you want - genetic predisposition.
<h2>Symptoms of colon polyps</h2>
The vast majority of patients rectal polyps are not clinically manifest and are found incidentally during endoscopic studies about other pathology or target population surveys. More than 78% of the polyps are those over 50 years old.<br><br> Solitary rectal polyps may for a long time does not clinically manifest. Joining inflammation or damage to the integrity of the rectal polyp helps release in excess of mucus or blood, as evidenced by the appearance of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/diarrhea.html">diarrhea</a> with mucus, blood.<br><br> In advanced polyposis, accompanied by <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">bleeding</a>, mucus, frequent stools, gradually developing anemia, emaciation. Polyps located in the exit of the rectum, especially on the leg, may fall during the act of defecation, bleeding and give infringed sphincter.
<h2>Complications</h2>
Complications of colon polyps: malignant degeneration, inflammatory diseases of the rectum, rectal fissures, abscess. Therefore we can not delay the treatment and immediately contact a proctologist.
<h2>Prevention</h2>
Timely detection and removal is almost always asymptomatic polyps - the main measure of prevention of colorectal cancer, especially among older adults.<br> For the prevention of colon polyps is recommended to observe the following guidelines:<br><br> - Presence of roughage in the diet (cabbage, beets, turnips, squash, apples, pumpkins)<br> - Preferring vegetable fats;<br> - Limited use of beer and alcoholic beverages that contribute to the development of tumors of the intestine.
<h2>What can your doctor?</h2>
Diagnosis of colorectal polyps and anal canal carries proctologist.<br> Polyp or colon polyps can be detected by digital examination. Location of polyps or colon polyps pa over 10 cm from the anus makes it possible to determine not only their presence, but at the same time find out the number, size, texture, displaceability, the presence or absence of leg ulceration. Additional information may be obtained by means of a special method of research - sigmoidoscopy, which also clarifies the extent and destruction. In the case of colon polyps by finger examination to clarify the extent of damage is necessary to conduct X-ray examination of the entire colon, as often polyposis colon polyposis combined with all or part of the colon. X-ray study not only provides an opportunity to find out the degree of damage of the colon, but in some cases, helps to establish malignancy of one or more polyps, the structure and length of the left half of the colon, which is most affected polyposis. In some cases, polyposis colorectal polyposis colon combined with the upstream segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, X-ray examination of the stomach is shown.<br><br> A radical treatment for colon polyps is the excision of a polyp.<br> Since the rectum polyps are precancerous condition, after their removal was performed with a dynamic observation - sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy.<br> If polyposis is secondary, due to ulcerative colitis, proctosigmoiditis, dysentery, it is necessary to treat the underlying disease. If it affects the entire colon polyposis, especially if this bleeding occur, the phenomenon of <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/proctology/proctitis.html">proctitis</a> with mucus and pus, one has to resort to the removal of the rectum.
<h2>What can you do?</h2>
If the patient notices any admixture of blood, mucus in the stool, or discomfort occurs during the act of defecation, <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/plague.html">plague</a>d by frequent urge to defecation, you need to see a specialist for advice.<br><br> Very often rectal polyps mistakenly confused with <a href="/diseases-and-conditions/proctology/hemorrhoids.html">hemorrhoids</a>. A treatment of these diseases is radically different.
