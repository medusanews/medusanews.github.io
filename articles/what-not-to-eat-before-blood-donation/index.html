<h2>Restrictions before taking blood samples</h2>

<p>Regardless of whether it is for a study you donate blood (for general analysis, sugar, for biochemical research, hormones, infection, etc.), preparation steps for the procedure will always be roughly the same.</p>

<p>In the first place, it will need to come fasting, i.e., not less than 6-8 hours after the last (not tight) meal. In some sources you can find that prior to entering the treatment room you for 12 hours or more in any case can not even look in the direction of the refrigerator. This is not true; the period of voluntary hunger strike for a period of 6-8 hours is enough.</p>

<p>As a rule, the complexities of this preparatory measure does not arise, because usually all the research blood is taken in the morning and after a nap, not every person is experiencing severe famine.</p>

<p>Most people have heard, and that before the analysis can not eat anything, but that their knowledge in preparation for the blood collection procedure usually exhausted. Nevertheless, there are certain restrictions and for the earlier period of the preparation. To analysis showed the most reliable results, for 2 days before the nurse bring to your hand syringe needle, you have to sit on a special diet. You are not recommended to eat:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fatty, fried, smoked foods;</li>
<li>Sweets and confectionery products in large quantities;</li>
</ul>


<p>If donating blood on a general analysis, it can be a bit neglected (that many, by the way, do), but more complex investigations such as biochemical analysis, determination of antibodies to infections, detection of cancer markers, immunogram, etc., require from patients greater diligence.</p>

<p>It is believed that before the blood sugar should be almost a week to refuse the use of carbohydrates in any form. In fact, it will need only a couple of days a sensible diet.</p>

<p>Carbohydrate consumed quickly or stocking up body, transformed into glycogen or fat, so that within a few hours after their use in the blood should not be a trace of &quot;extra&quot; sugar - if the patient is certainly not ill severe diabetes. But for such situations, people usually know in advance, so already receiving treatment and control your diet.</p>

<p>Very often patients confidentially divided among themselves that they have ignored the preparation for a particular study, and they &quot;had nothing&quot;. For this reason, some people are also beginning to question the logic of the requirements of the doctor. There is a thought: &quot;And what will happen if you do not prepare for the analysis?&quot; Of course, it may be that you&rsquo;re lucky and it will not affect the quality of the results. However, excesses of food before a <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/blood-test-biochemical.html" title="blood test">blood test</a> can cause false data receipt.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple example. After the meal, there is a man called physiologic leukocytosis - cells are white blood cells at a time out of the tissues into the bloodstream, and the amount of blood increases.</p>

<p>If you make a general analysis of the patient, who has recently eaten, this figure could be his inflated, because of what the doctor will suggest the presence of infection in the body and starts up and down to survey the unfortunate patient who is merely frivolous attitude to training&hellip; similar erroneous situations can occur at the time of other analyzes.</p>

<h2>Restrictions before taking blood donation</h2>

<p>But here the situation is different, however, the differences are not so great.</p>

<p>As for the early transition to comply with the above diet, this requirement exists for donors. Eating fatty, fried and other junk food before taking the blood impairs the quality of harvested materials. Incidentally, the &quot;no&quot; in this case, apply also on protein foods - meat, cheese, eggs, cheese, etc., they create a large load on the immune system and human kidney, which are transfused components of your blood.</p>

<p>It is characteristic that, if you do not follow a diet and to the right to take the plasma you immediately incriminate insufficient training. The plasma (blood serum) in patients who are on the eve of fat eaten, a little cloudy, and has a unique, slightly grayish-greenish tint&hellip;</p>

<p>Restrictions before taking blood or plasma donation on more serious than before the tests, but the day of the procedure, the donor is not waiting for the hunger strike, but rather an indulgence in the diet. He can afford a light breakfast (no forbidden foods), best of all, consisting of carbohydrate foods.</p>

<p>Tea or coffee with biscuits, drying, or a pair of candy fit perfectly. Once at the station transfusion his blood examined and the person will give the &quot;green light&quot; for the change, there he asked to drink more tea and biscuits and chocolate. Besides, you do not have to carry a thermos and a bag with a sweet, nice bonus that will be given to you right there.</p>

<p>So, whether you are pursuing your own interests (donates blood for tests) or doing good to others (sacrifice her as a donor), before the procedure of putting in something have to deny yourself a little sit on a diet. Do not let that upset, because in both cases, your goals deserve to suffer some inconvenience for them. Moreover, the dietary restrictions will last very long&hellip;</p>
