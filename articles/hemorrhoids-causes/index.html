Hemorrhoids called the veins of the rectum, resulting in the formation hemorrhoids that cause severe pain (especially in the act of defecation), bleed, fall out and cause a lot of people suffering physical and social problems.</p>




<!-- more -->




<p>Unfortunately, hemorrhoids have traditionally been considered &lsquo;shameful&rsquo; intimate problem and therefore postponed the visit to the doctor, as a rule, to the last, when the disease has already started and is accompanied by a strong unbearable bolyu.Po to the proctologist, about 70% of people experience these or other symptoms</p>




<h2>Causes of hemorrhoids</h2>




<p>Causes of hemorrhoids are quite diverse &ndash; an impetus to the development of the disease can provide both genetic factors (congenital anomalies of venous walls) and the error in the diet, unhealthy lifestyle, chronic internal diseases and pregnancy.</p>




<p><strong>Among the main causes of the disease doctors are the following:</strong></p>




<p>Long-term sedentary work leads to stagnation of blood in the pelvic organs. Therefore, the risk of disease has traditionally include all workers of &ldquo;sedentary&rdquo; jobs &ndash; drivers, accountants, operators, programmers, and the like</p>




<p>A sedentary lifestyle also contributes to the development of hemorrhoids, as due to lack of physical activity, and there is blood stasis is formed venous insufficiency.</p>




<p>Finding feet long and considerable physical load is not less harmful than hypodynamy as delay provokes blood in the veins and increase the pressure therein, resulting in venous wall gradually loses its elasticity. This process is most susceptible to teachers, dancers, hair stylists, as well as loaders and lifters.</p>




<p>Chronic constipation, according to the doctors, are the most common cause of hemorrhoids. As a result of constipation bowel movement feces inside difficult, it accumulates in the lower parts of it and pinched the vein, thus significantly impairing blood flow. In addition, further increase intra-abdominal pressure attempts suffering severe constipation in the act of defecation.</p>




<p>Alcohol and spicy food. Hot spices contribute to a strong flow of blood to the rectum and irritate the delicate lining of her. Alcohol provokes an excessive expansion of blood vessels and blood stagnation in the formation and inflammation of hemorrhoids.</p>




<p>Different tumors and inflammation in the pelvis often causes the development of hemorrhoids. These include gynecological problems (fibroids, uterine fibroids), inflammation of the prostate, liver cirrhosis, cancer of the rectum, as well as fistulas, ulcers and fissures.</p>




<p>Pregnancy and childbirth. During pregnancy, the growing uterus displaces all the organs of the pelvis up and the rectum, on the contrary, pressed down to the pelvic bone, squeezing blood vessels and helping to expand the veins and the formation of hemorrhoids. In the process of childbirth situation is further aggravated by the strong attempts mothers.</p>




<h2>Internal and external hemorrhoids</h2>




<p>Hemorrhoids is divided into inner and outer, depending on where the hemorrhoids are located outside or inside.</p>




<p>When an internal hemorrhoid nodes are located in the lumen of the rectum. Outside the acute stage they are not visible to the eye and are determined only by special equipment. In the initial stage of internal hemorrhoids person usually has no idea of ​​developing the disease, while internal hemorrhoids do not begin to emerge in the act of defecating outside.</p>




<p>For external hemorrhoids nodes are outside around the anus, where they can be easily detected during normal feeling, even in the primary, painless stage. In practice, quite often (about 50% of cases) occurs combined hemorrhoids, which combines features of external and internal types.</p>




<h2>Symptoms and stages of hemorrhoids</h2>




<p>The first symptoms of hemorrhoids are usually quite low, so they do not pay too much attention. However, as the disease progresses, all the unpleasant and painful sensations are enhanced.</p>




<p>First, the disease manifests itself only a feeling of heaviness or a sensation of a foreign body in the anus &ndash; this is due to swelling of the internal tissues of the anal canal.</p>




<p>After that arise in the anus itching and burning &ndash; a consequence of increasing the hemorrhoids, which is accompanied by minor blood and mucus secretions and causes irritation of the skin around the anus.</p>




<p>Then there are regular bleeding during discharge (of varying intensity). If at this stage to start emergency treatment hemorrhoids begin to precipitate and severe pain is constant, not only during defecation, but also in a sitting position and walking.</p>




<p>Proctologists distinguish 4 stages of hemorrhoids, depending on how much enlarged nodes, and how developed the degenerative process in the tissues muscle.</p>




<p>The first stage &ndash; increasing hemorrhoids, there is itching, burning, foreign body sensation in the anus, there are slight discharge of blood at the time of discharge. Because these symptoms are not permanent and occur only occasionally, the vast number of patients at this stage of hemorrhoids do not go to the doctor, the disease moves to the next stage.</p>




<p>The second stage &ndash; during bowel movements begin to &ldquo;creep&rdquo; nodules on toilet paper appearing regularly drop of blood. At this stage the nodes themselves are hiding back after bowel movements or a short period of time.</p>




<p>The third step &ndash; dropping nodes patient has to reduce a hand into the rectum to achieve more &ndash; less comfortable state. At this stage, the disease is already advanced, progressive and requires immediate medical attention, as the nodules begin to fall, not only during defecation, but also with any increase in intra-abdominal pressure (coughing, sneezing, lifting weights and even with little physical load).</p>




<p>The fourth stage &ndash; hemorrhoids will not reduce a fall or immediately after the reduction, look like bunch of grapes, very inflamed and painful. At this stage, very frequent bleeding, and pain in the anus is so strong that it is impossible to even touch the toilet paper. Intense frequent bleeding lead to anemia (low hemoglobin in the blood), which further worsens the patient&rsquo;s well-being.</p>




<p>In addition, the constant loss of hemorrhoids anal sphincter tone is reduced, and this may be total or partial incontinence of gas and liquid stool, which is a huge additional psychological problem for patients.</p>




<h2>Hemorrhoid Treatment at present</h2>




<p>Hemorrhoid Treatment in modern conditions completely depends on the stage of the disease &ndash; the sooner you start treatment, the better and faster will be the end result.</p>




<p>Unfortunately, the fourth stage of the disease, and, in some cases, with the third, no surgery do not work, so see your doctor as soon as possible and do not diagnose yourself by yourself. Self-treatment of hemorrhoids is dangerous because its symptoms such as itching, pain, bleeding and mucus, characteristic of many other diseases, including cancer.</p>




<p>According to medical statistics, in Europe, colorectal cancer ranks second among all diseases after lung cancer. This is due primarily to the fact that patients often go to the doctor too late, allowing you to develop many of the pathological processes and letting them start. There are cases where people have their own long-term cure hemorrhoids local Foot and micro enema, and as a result are hospitalized with terminal cancer of the colon.</p>




<p>If a proctologist after a comprehensive survey put you diagnose hemorrhoids, take responsibility for his recommendations, because the time to initiation of treatment will help in most cases, to avoid surgery and cure hemorrhoids without pain and complications. Under current conditions, only 5 -10% of cases of hemorrhoids require surgical intervention, in other successfully conducted minimally invasive non-surgical treatment methods.</p>




<p>In the first stage of hemorrhoids can be successfully treated with folk remedies, flebotropnyh drugs, various ointments, suppositories and preventive measures (special diet, therapeutic exercise, and the normalization of the bowel). If the disease is accompanied by hemorrhoidal bleeding, to eliminate it on the first and second stages of the disease is effective method of sclerotherapy.</p>




<p>After a few treatments of sclerotherapy improved tone of the anal canal, swelling and inflammation subside, the pain disappears. The procedure is as follows &ndash; a hemorrhoid or under the mucous membrane next to him is a special sklerotiruyuschim injection drug. Under the influence of drugs node is compacted, reduced in size and eventually atrophies (waived).</p>




<p>On the second and third stages of the patient may be asked to latekstnoe ligation sites &ndash; the newest popular method of treating hemorrhoids proctology in the world, which is a low-invasive, painless and performed on an outpatient basis. The essence of it is this &ndash; with the help of special devices on the hemorrhoid puts special latekstnoe ring that pinches the leg assembly and blocks blood flow in it. About a week and there is no manipulation of the node is expelled with the faeces.</p>




<p>Even if you have stage four of hemorrhoids, do not despair, modern proctology is not standing still and painful surgery hemorrhoidectomy with long-term disability benefits for a long time in the past. Instead, surgeons have successfully used the latest technology called &ldquo;desertisation hemorrhoids through suture ligation.&rdquo; Desertisation made, usually under local anesthesia in a day hospital, lasts no more than 30 &ndash; 40 minutes and a few hours after surgery, the patient may be allowed to go home.</p>
