<h2>The role of physical therapy for patients with diabetes</h2>




<p>The violation of protein and fat metabolism in the body accumulates toxins and it is poisoning products of incomplete combustion of fats. In addition, disturbance of lipid metabolism leads to the fact that blood fat filled, it increases bad cholesterol, thereby repeatedly increased risk of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases.</p>




<p>Exercise therapy is shown not only in all types of diabetes (except for depleted due to untreated or poorly the treatment of diabetes patients), but also when prediabetnom condition. Modern research shows that, if we strictly adhere to the prescribed diet, exercise and give up bad habits &ndash; overeating, smoking and alcohol, then go into pre-diabetes mellitus can be avoided.</p>




<p>According to currently available data, the most common occurrence and development of diabetes contributes to overeating. That is why a person full-bodied and with disturbances in metabolism, need to understand that once in a painful exchange process will involve carbohydrate metabolism, inevitably develop diabetes.</p>




<p>In connection with this, people with excess body weight, being at risk of diabetes, must periodically tested for the presence of sugar in the blood and urine, to detect the first time the symptoms of the disease and to begin treatment. In addition to weight loss, you should pay attention to the following common symptoms of incipient diabetes &ndash; long nezazhivlenie wounds, abrasions resistant to treatment, itching, bleeding gums, loosening of teeth, impotence.</p>




<h2>Features of physical therapy for patients with diabetes</h2>




<p>The main objectives of physical therapy for patients with diabetes:</p>




<p>Improving cardiovascular and respiratory systems;

Reducing hyperglycaemia in non-insulin (type 2 diabetes) and the potentiation of insulin in patients with insulin-dependent (type 1 diabetes);
Opposition to the development of micro-and macrovascular.</p>




<p>In diabetes, insulin deficiency addition, broken oxidative processes in the muscle due to which they can not utilize glucose. At the same physical stress oxidative enzyme activity is significantly enhanced in the blood are increased alkaline reserves, thereby increasing the uptake and consumption of glucose by muscles, decreases hyperglycemia and increased tolerance of the organism in carbohydrates. In addition, exercise in combination with insulin increase the therapeutic effect of insulin, strengthen the nervous and cardiovascular system of the patient, increase the body&rsquo;s resistance and prevent the development of atherosclerosis.</p>




<p>The distinctive feature of LFC in diabetes is that the recommended exercises should be performed in a moderate (Slower) rate, as well as muscular effort. In the anaerobic organism not occur and oxidation processes that contribute to the increase of glucose by muscles.</p>




<p>Classes begin physiotherapy is recommended to elementary exercises for the muscles of the legs, arms and torso with no encumbrances, combining with breathing exercises.  In addition to physical therapy, are useful dosed walking, rowing, cycling, swimming pool, skiing, gardening, light physical work.</p>




<p>When doing physical therapy you need to carefully monitor their well-being &ndash; if after playing the feeling of weakness or fatigue, the load must be reduced. If training were to shake hands, there was a strong feeling of hunger and weakness, you need to eat 1 to 2 pieces of sugar and immediately stop training. Resuming workout just a day after the disappearance of the symptoms of hypoglycemia, while reducing the dosage. Patients with diabetes who are on insulin therapy, in the days of long and intense physical activities recommended to reduce the dose of insulin (after consultation with the attending physician).</p>




<p>LFC need to conduct studies in a well-ventilated room or outdoors, breathing in this case should be free and rhythmic, through your nose and exhale longer inspiratory time. Physical exercise is necessary to alternate the different muscle groups and perform with a large amplitude in the joints.</p>




<p>Repeat each exercise should be 5-6 times in the future, to the extent of fitness, you can enhance the load by reducing breaks, increasing the rate and number of repetitions. Age is not a barrier to practice physical therapy, monitoring the patient&rsquo;s state of health is the only changes and hyperglycemia and weight.</p>




<p>Since the blood sugar level rises patient after a night&rsquo;s sleep, (which partly explains quiet sleep) are most useful gymnastics, and light walking exercise in the morning, as they not only lower blood glucose, but also promote the release of insulin in a more  But, if possible, try to exercise and in the evening (for 1.5 &ndash; 2 hours before bedtime) to secure an equivalent exercise for the day.</p>
