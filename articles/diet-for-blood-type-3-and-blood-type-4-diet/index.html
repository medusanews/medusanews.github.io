Blood type diet by Dr. Peter D&#8217;Adamo has gained immense popularity all over the world, because it is very simple, effective and useful. Ease of it is that, when it is not necessary to calculate the compliance scores, indexes, calories and grams, as in other diet programs.</p>

<p>The efficiency of the power system is that it is very natural and offers catering exclusively products that are genetically adapted to the digestive tract of a particular person, that provides a great metabolism.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In addition, the blood type diet is healthy as eating the recommended &ldquo;proper&rdquo; food, people not only lose weight, but at the same time heals. According to Dr. D&#8217;Adamo, useful products act in the body as the most effective medicine, neutral &ndash; provide its power and energy, and harmful &ndash; poison, destroy and old.</p>

<p>The previous was described in detail the essence of the diet for blood type, classification and evolution of blood types in the world, as well as recommendations for the preparation of the menu for the first and second types.</p>

<h2>Diet for blood type 3 (type B)</h2>

<p>Diet for blood type is the third mixed and balanced, as &ldquo;nomads&rdquo; are omnivorous and equally well with a meat, dairy products and plant foods. People of this type generally have a strong immune, nervous system, strong and well adapted to changes in the diet and environment. But, despite this, unbalanced diet may be an autoimmune disease and a rare virus and are at risk for multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome and diabetes type 1.</p>

<p>Diet for weight loss in type people should avoid to the maximum foods that are high in sugar, fat, fried and smoked food, as the latter contribute to weight gain and adversely affect the liver. At the time, it is recommended to eat a diet low interest milk and milk products, vegetables (except tomatoes, pumpkins and olives), fruits, legumes, eggs and cereals (except buckwheat and wheat).</p>

<p>Of the preferred meat lamb, beef and turkey, pork should be excluded because of the high fat content, and a chicken because of its long digestion in people with the third type of blood. Should also be avoided during weight loss contribute to weight gain buckwheat, corn and peanuts, which reduce insulin production, slowing the body&rsquo;s metabolism and contribute to water retention. Give up sodas, and tomato juice, drink plenty of water, green tea and juices &ndash; cranberry, grape, pineapple, cabbage.</p>

<p>People with the third type of blood lose weight is relatively easy compared to other types, as they for weight loss, the exclusion from the diet of fatty foods, meats, fried foods and limit the use of &ldquo;binding&rdquo; fruit &ndash; persimmon, coconut, pomegranate, peanuts. Therefore, they can recommend any protein or carbohydrate diet &ndash; perfect rice, oats, kefir or any other mono-diet (except buckwheat), and the results of weight loss usually appear very quickly after the start of its implementation. In humans type suitable even &ldquo;chocolate diet&rdquo;, provided that the chocolate is black and no sugar added.</p>

<h2>Diet for blood type 4 (type AB)</h2>

<p>The fourth type is the young blood and rare (about 5% of the population), and its owners are sensitive and delicate digestive tract and the immune system is very vulnerable, are not resistant to microbes and cons of having both types &ndash; A and B. People of this type often suffer reduced hemoglobin, and also have a predisposition to heart disease and cancer.</p>

<p>Due to the combinations of types A and B in the preparation of a diet frequently occur since the same person can be reduced gastric acidity (type A) while adapting to the meat (Type B). In this case, although the programming of meat consumption, for its digestion lacks gastric juice, which ultimately leads to the deposition of fat. With this option, you need to limit the amount of meat consumed and increase the intake of vegetables and tofu, which is a great source of protein for both type A and type B for</p>

<p>The same problem often occurs when using buckwheat, corn and beans, as for type A, they are the perfect products recommended, and in type to the slow metabolism and promote weight gain. Therefore, for type AB should avoid these products, as well as products made from wheat because it contains gluten, contributing to weight gain.</p>

<p><strong>Special dietary recommendations for type AB:</strong></p>

<p>Useful low-fat meat products &ndash; turkey, lamb, rabbit, pork is prohibited, fatty lamb, goose, duck.
Recommended dairy products &ndash; yogurt, low-fat cheese and sour cream; eliminated whole milk, and butter.
Useful to use olive oil, but from sunflower and corn should be avoided.
Bread and cereals.
Of bakery products and cereals can be eaten bread from rye and wheat germ, oatmeal, rice cereal and millet; prohibited baking, buckwheat, corn flakes.
Of all the vegetables are recommended, except olives, peppers and corn, are excluded from the fruit bananas, mangoes, persimmons, oranges, coconut and grenades.
Other banned products.
On a diet give up the ketchup, vinegar, pepper, black tea, orange juice, sunflower seeds.</p>

<p>As you can see, the diet for Type AB is not very strict, so it does not require radically change dietary habits, need only to be upgraded by replacing the fat to lean meat, and other high-calorie and fatty foods to a more appropriate.</p>

<h3>Exercise as an adjunct to diet</h3>

<p>Moderate regular exercise are a great addition to the diet in the fight against excess weight. So, for the first type of people are most effective intense aerobics, skiing, swimming and running, for the second type is more suited calm and focus yoga and tai chi, and for the third and fourth &ndash; balanced sports (swimming, yoga, cycling, walking.</p>

<h3>Cautions on a diet</h3>

<p>It should be noted that the blood type diet, despite their effectiveness, can be harmful to the elderly in relation to age-related changes in the body, as well as for patients with certain health problems.</p>

<p>For example, the first and second type of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases need to limit the consumption of meat and increased consumption of raw fruits and vegetables, even one blood type, because if power is not adjusted to reflect these features can significantly harm  Same people with anemia or a lack of protein, on the contrary, increase the consumption of meat in the diet, regardless of the type of.</p>

<p>The call to increase the consumption of dairy products can be harmful in congenital lactose intolerance, and vice versa, limiting them can provoke a lack of calcium and bone problems.</p>

<p>Furthermore, any unbalanced diet is known to cause both a lack of essential nutrients, and their excess that equally good for the body. People suffering from diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease or ischemic heart disease, it is not recommended to strictly adhere to supply the same blood type. Throughout the need to comply with the measure, common sense and strict medical supervision chosen diet.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would like to point out that we should not scrupulously follow the recommendations listed above, be sure to listen to your body and heed its own individual characteristics. It is important that your food was not painful and agonizing, and strengthened health, pleasure and joy of life.</p>
