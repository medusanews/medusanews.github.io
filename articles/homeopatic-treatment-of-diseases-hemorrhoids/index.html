Hemorrhoids"> Hemorrhoid is an inflammation of veins in the rectum, where they expand, so that nodes are formed.</p>

<h2>Stages of hemorrhoids</h2>

<p>In the first stage of development and the severity of patients experience itching in the rectum, frequent constipation. Stronger feelings are after weight lifting, spicy food and drinking alcohol.</p>

<p>The second stage is characterized by the appearance of bleeding hemorrhoids fall out, the pain is getting stronger and more.</p>

<p>Sign of the next stage of hemorrhoids &ndash; hemorrhoids do not reduce a, resulting in an thrombosis or necrosis of the veins of the rectum.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of hemorrhoids</h2>

<p>The first striking symptom of hemorrhoids &ndash; is bleeding during each act of defecation. Also, patients notice a prolapsed hemorrhoid, a burning sensation and pain in the anus, feeling the presence of a foreign object into the anus and the severity of the groin.</p>

<p>Immediately, we note that emit sharp and chronic hemorrhoids. In acute discomfort of the disease is stronger and brighter, whereas in chronic long can not be felt and gain strength only in certain periods of life. Among the symptoms of acute hemorrhoids also present perianal swelling.</p>

<p>Next, hemorrhoids noted mucus from the anus, and finally, pain hemorrhoids.</p>

<h2>Hemorrhoid treatment drugs classical medicine</h2>

<p>As with any other disease, hemorrhoids are much easier to treat in the early stages. It was in the early periods of the disease can take advantage of non-surgical treatments. When hemorrhoids are very important the correct way of life that takes into account both traditional medicine and homeopathy.</p>

<h2>Lifestyle hemorrhoids</h2>

<p>The first and most important thing for hemorrhoids &ndash; to begin to move more, will be useful not too heavy physical activities, including swimming. From large loads should be avoided, as with alcohol and spicy food.</p>

<p>Diet plays a huge role in the treatment of hemorrhoids. As mentioned above, you need to stop eating bad foods in the diet and increase the number of fruits and vegetables.</p>

<h2>Treatment of hemorrhoids</h2>

<p>Proper treatment of hemorrhoids in classical medicine depends on what stage of development is a disease. For example, in the early stages to achieve the result by using the drug, but the drugs are aimed primarily at reducing the discomfort, rather than knocking causes disease. They decrease pain, improve blood flow and reduce inflammation. There are local medications such as ointments and candles, and there are those that are taken orally, such as tablets and injections.</p>

<p>As soon as a thrombosis, as indicated by increased pain and discomfort in the anal area, ointments prescribed blood-thinning. The point of this is to not allow the blood to clot. In the case of very heavy bleeding from hemorrhoids begin receiving hemostatic drugs.</p>

The latter procedure is good even in the third stage of hemorrhoids.</p>

<h3>Surgery for hemorrhoids</h3>
