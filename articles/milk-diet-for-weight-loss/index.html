Someone like olives, some do not; someone loves caviar, and someone can not understand what&rsquo;s so special. So it is with milk: it has both fans and haters. However, in some form or other dairy products they consume almost everything and most people refer to it quite bearable. If you - among them, and want to lose a few extra kilos, you can get acquainted with several options dairy diet, which will be discussed in this post.</p>

<p>Thus, the basis of dietary food in this case is milk. And, as varieties of this product, there is quite a lot, and opinions diverge about the choice.</p>

<p>Most dieters claim that, once go on a diet, it is necessary to choose only low-fat product or a maximum of 0.5-1.5% milk, which contains only 39-47 <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/figs-diet-for-weight-loss/" title="calories">calories</a> per 100 ml. However, we advise you to seek the smallest <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/diet-aphrodite/" title="figure">figures</a>, because in the process of normalization (bringing the milk to the desired fat content), it partially loses its valuable properties. The fact that the fat-soluble vitamins useful and other components partially extracted from it, together with the &quot;surplus&quot; fats. Moreover, milk fat is not as dangerous as &quot;normal&quot; animal, which is contained in fat and fat meat. Its main components are useful phospholipids rather than potentially threatening <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/atherosclerosis.html" title="atherosclerosis">atherosclerosis</a> <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/when-to-calibrate-their-cholesterol-triglyceride-and-hdl-cholesterol/" title="cholesterol">cholesterol</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, you can not pay so much attention to the choice of issues. Will suit you like milk with 1.5%, and the &quot;standard&quot;, with 2.5% fat content, which can be found in every store. Although, of course, if you do opt for the 6% of the product or liquid cream, it is unlikely to benefit figure.</p>

<p><strong>As milk diet effect on the body?</strong></p>

<p>This in itself has a low calorie milk and contains small amounts of protein required in the diet body. Actually, that&rsquo;s all, what are its advantages when it comes to <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/watermelon-diet/" title="weight loss">weight loss</a>. Fat is not mobilized, a depressing effect on the appetite does not, on the blood sugar level is not affected. It&rsquo;s just a useful product small calorie, which can be used as a dietary. The effect of a diet is to ensure that the diet is severely limited energy value.</p>

<p>Itself milk diet, in whatever form it is employed, is rigid and is usually not perfectly balanced, so it is not recommended for a long time.</p>

<h2>Types of milk diet</h2>

<p>If we approach the issue of transfer of dairy diet with all the responsibility, you can find a dozen different versions of it, in which as the dominant power component acts milk. But the most commonly used are 3 types.</p>

<p>It is intended for use during the day (as the handling of the day), the most healthy people are allowed to use it for 3 days. On day <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/how-to-lose-weight-at-home/" title="slimming">slimming</a> offered 1 liter of milk; moreover, it can drinking ordinary water and mineral. That is, in fact, mono-diet on milk is <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/starvation.html" title="starvation">starvation</a>.</p>

<p>During the day it takes about 500-700 g of weight, three days you can lose up to 2 kg. But, in any case, it requires the observance of the human ideal health, and sit on it longer than strictly prohibited.</p>

<p>By the choice of food it can be characterized as a protein, because during its compliance permitted only various embodiments of dairy products. You can drink milk, yogurt, fermented baked low-fat, low-fat cottage cheese has, diet cheese, unsweetened yogurt. Glazed cheese, ice cream, yoghurt, sweet, cream, sour cream - all this, of course, prohibited.</p>

<p>Ingestion performed 5-6 times per day total caloric intake calculated individually for women - not less than 1200 kcal, if it is supposed to adhere for 1 week, and not less than 1500 kcal, when it is planned to extend for 14 days.</p>

<p>Longer &quot;sitting&quot; on the expanded dairy diet is contraindicated, since such power marked a clear shortage of fats and carbohydrates, which can lead to adverse effects on the part of health. As for the results, then a week on it, you can lose about 2-3 kg.</p>

<p>From the listed options for the most useful and safe. It consists in the fact that, along with the milk (1-1.5 liters per day), a person is allowed to eat fresh fruits and vegetables, salads and boiled or baked vegetables. Excluded are only those plant foods that contain too much sugar and starch (corn, potatoes, grapes). Should be fed 4-6 times a day, calculated calorie in the same manner as the previous embodiment diet.</p>

<p>Since vegetables and fruits generally lower in calories than the milk-based products, the amount of power becomes greater, and diet quite easily tolerated. But more than 2 weeks of her stay is not necessary, you need to take a break for at least 10 days. And another recommendation: if you are planning a meal with the addition of fresh fruits and vegetables, do not drink milk immediately after use, it is better do it in an hour and a half. Due to the high acid content in vegetable products in such a combination may cause <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/diarrhea.html" title="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>.</p>
