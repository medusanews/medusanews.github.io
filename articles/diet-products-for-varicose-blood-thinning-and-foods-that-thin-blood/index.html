<div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/foods-that-thin-blood/image.jpg" width="200" height="150" title="Diet for varicose veins, blood thinning products, foods that thin blood, varicose veins diet" alt="Diet products for varicose blood thinning and foods that thin blood"> Diet for varicose thins the blood and improves venous blood flow. Proper nutrition and therapeutic diet for varicose plays a huge role in the treatment and prevention of disease, as it allows not only to reduce excess weight, thereby significantly reducing the burden on travmatiruyuschuyu diseased veins, but also by good selection of food, thin out the blood and significantly improve.</p>

<p>For the prevention of varicose veins is first necessary to eliminate the risk factors that create additional pressure on the venous system, the most damaging of which are the extra pounds. The more overweight a person is thicker than the subcutaneous layer of fat, the greater the pressure exerted on the blood vessel wall that is not made of concrete.</p>

<p>This is why people who are overweight, even without overt signs of varicose veins is strictly forbidden to lift weights over 5 pounds, as an additional burden on the lifted weight greatly increases the pressure on the blood vessels and worsens their condition until critical.</p>

<h2>Diet for varicose veins</h2>

<p>Diet for varicose veins is designed to restore proper nutrition, promotes the normalization of weight and transpose blood clotting &ndash; a major risk of varicose veins.</p>

<p>As you know, in varicose veins the blood becomes thick and viscous, causing blood particles &ldquo;stick together&rdquo; to form clots in various parts of the body, usually in the groin, behind the knees and calves, which is a very dangerous condition. The high viscosity of the blood increases the risk of blood clots in the blood vessels and the heart, so the task of thinning it is of paramount importance.</p>

<p>Hemodilution contributes not only diet but also enough drinking regime, as blood is 90% of the water. According to doctors, all vascular patients drink too little of plain water, but for them it is a matter of life and death, especially in the heat. It was in the heat dramatically increases the number of heart attacks and strokes &ndash; a person sweats, loses a lot of moisture, and the vessels are much narrower and the blood thickens.</p>

<p>Therefore, to make the body physiological costs and ensure the usefulness of metabolic processes, you need to drink daily for at least 2 &ndash; 2.5 liters of good quality water &ndash; this is the first natural remedy for thinning the blood, which is always at hand. When used as a dirty, chlorinated water or unstructured body expends a lot of energy at the intracellular level, to transform it.</p>

<p>In addition to water, you can drink green or mint tea and natural fruit and vegetable juices. Especially useful for varicose veins are considered juice from red grapes, lemon, orange, tomato, cranberry and any sour grapes. From beer and alcohol should be avoided, as they are diuretic foods that contribute to dehydration and thickening of blood.</p>

<p>This thickened blood thinners for its active physicians prescribe drugs aspirin because it contains salicylic acid (vitamin C), according to research scientists, not only substantially reduces the viscosity of the blood, but also reduces the workload on the heart muscle and reduces the risk of cardiac and  But all is not rosy as it might seem at first glance. Permissible safe therapeutic dose of aspirin should not exceed 75-100 mg per day, and the excess of it, not only negates the positive effect, but also leads to the opposite result &ndash; the incessant nosebleeds to fatal internal blood loss.</p>

<p>Increasing the dose of aspirin leads to sweatshops effect and blood clots. Therefore, independent, without a doctor&rsquo;s prescription, taking aspirin for the &ldquo;prevention&rdquo; rather than sin in recent years, many people, eating handfuls of it, is totally unacceptable. In addition, it should be noted that aspirin, even intravenous use, very aggressive effect on the digestive tract and cause erosion and ulcers in the stomach wall.</p>

<h2>Foods that thin blood</h2>

<p>Forming the diet menu for varicose veins, you know that there are natural products that contribute to thinning the blood better than aspirin &ndash; they who must always be present on your desktop. For example, a few spoonfuls of raspberry jam, in its effect replace aspirin. And vice versa &ndash; the foods that thin blood, should be possible to eliminate from your diet.</p>

<p>Of vascular doctors generally advise patients to hang in a prominent place in the kitchen are two lists &ndash; the &ldquo;white&rdquo; list of foods and blood thinners &ldquo;black&rdquo; list of banned products, which it is concentrated and strictly check with them their food. After all, our health, by and large, had read it to the dinner table and each product has its own power supply &ldquo;chemistry&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Diet for varicose veins should primarily be aimed at improving the work of the liver, as in all patients varices, deviations in its work. Do not forget that the liver is called the chemical laboratory of the body &ndash; it is responsible for all metabolic processes and generates the necessary substances that prevent blood clots. If the liver is healthy, then the formation of clots in blood vessels, in principle, impossible. But, unfortunately, poor environment, poor diet, alcohol, drugs and an abundance of forcing her to work at full capacity.</p>

<p>Therefore, proper nutrition with varicose veins should be as restrictive of the liver, you need to limit fats, meats, pickles, preserves, sausages, meat broth, jelly, cream and white bread. In addition to the &ldquo;black list&rdquo; of foods that thin blood, are bananas, mango, rose, lentils, walnuts, chokeberry, aronia juice and pomegranate.</p>

<p>A list of useful products, blood thinners, big enough &ndash; flaxseed and olive oil, fish and fish oil, tomato juice, apple cider vinegar, lemons, grapefruit, sunflower seeds, chocolate, cocoa, beets, berries (raspberries, cranberries, blueberries, strawberries,  Regular use of garlic in food, according to research by scientists, is capable of existing clots sucked in half, so try to regularly introduce garlic to your diet.</p>

<p>Additionally, the menu should include products containing magnesium, which inhibits the formation of blood clots. A lot of magnesium is found in oatmeal, oat flour, oatmeal and ginger.</p>

<p>As for herbs, patients with varicose veins should be taken to use them with great caution, as the grass &ndash; it is a serious drug that courses need to be used under medical supervision. For example, the most popular herbs in the people, have the ability to thicken the blood, and therefore contraindicated in patients with vascular &ndash; nettle, St. John&rsquo;s wort, yarrow, corn silk, valerian, mountaineer pochechuyny.</p>

<p>Of useful herbs that promote the resorption of blood clots and do not allow adhesion of red blood cells, can be called hazel, Bees, chicory, meadowsweet (meadowsweet), and wormwood. Chicory leaves useful in cutting lettuce, Bees and add meadowsweet tea and hazelnuts consumed in all kinds.</p>

<p>Typically, the ordering of food and proper diet, soon there is a significant improvement in the disease course. Many doctors argue that without surgery can cure any containers (not only vessels of the lower limbs) &ndash; if the time to cleanse the body of toxins, regular use in food products and blood thinning seek the help of natural remedies.</p>

<p>If you already have thrombophlebitis, very useful to regularly eat a mixture of onions, garlic, honey and lemon. Mix 200 g onions, garlic, 100 grams, 50 grams and 100 grams of lemon honey. and take 3 times a day for 1 tsp</p>

<p>To solve the problem of varicose veins, then revise their bad habits as alcohol, smoking and drugs (especially birth control, hormone and diuretics) significantly increase the viscosity of the blood. You also need to protect themselves from possible stress and engage in moderate exercise, since the inactivity red blood cells literally &ldquo;stick&rdquo; to the walls of blood vessels. A set of special physical exercises to help stop the development of varicose veins and prevent its progression, discussed in detail in the article on our website.</p>
