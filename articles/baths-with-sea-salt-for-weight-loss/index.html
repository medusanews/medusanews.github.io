<p>It is known that sea salt has a rich mineral structure, which ensures its beneficial properties. Seawater contains almost half of the periodic table, and a similar chemical composition is derived from its salt. Today sea salt is obtained in the same ways that a century ago - by evaporation. The elements contained in sea water in the greatest concentration, remain dry sea salt. These include:</p>

<p><em>Sodium and potassium</em> - contribute to the removal of the cells of the body of metabolic products.</p>

<p><em>Bromine</em> - has a calming effect on the nervous system.</p>

<p>In small quantities of sea salt in the presence of <em>gold, silver, palladium, selenium, boron, manganese, zinc, silicon, nickel</em>, and other minerals.</p>

<p>Concentrated saline is slightly irritating epidermis, increasing blood flow in small blood vessels. Because of this, the metabolic processes in the cells of the skin and subcutaneous tissue increase. Thus, salt bath help to improve skin appearance and to some extent reduce the appearance of cellulite. Salt also has anti-inflammatory properties, dries small foci of inflammation, so that the skin after bath salt looks more smooth and even.</p>

<p>Although bath and cosmetic products with sea salt is recommended for <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/gone-month-after-weight-loss-how-to-restore-the-month-following-the-diet/" title="weight loss">weight loss</a>, the very salt of any fat burning properties are not allowed. And &quot;weight loss&quot; after a bath with sea salt does not occur because of the volume reduction of body fat. Just by dissolving the salt in water to create a hot hyperosmotic solution that extends from the body &quot;extra&quot; liquid and reduces swelling.</p>

<p>Soothing or, conversely, a tonic effect bath with sea salt can be obtained by adding to the water an essential oil or a decoction of herbs with the appropriate action.</p>

<p>The implications are clear: such procedures do not allow to lose weight, but they may help a bit to lose weight by providing the body drain effect. They also help in the fight against cosmetic defects of the skin and affect overall health.</p>

<p>Sea salt bath can be purchased in almost any pharmacy or store. It is better to <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/choosing-a-anti-stretch-marks-cream-after-giving-birth/" title="choose">choose</a> a salt without any coloring and flavoring agents, because the contact with them may cause skin irritation or allergic reaction.</p>

<p>The amount of salt required for a bath, generally indicated on the packaging. Typically, the means take 300-500 grams per 200 liters of water. Adding more salt than is recommended, in the hope of a more pronounced effect, you only get increased dryness and flaking of the skin. Keep this in mind and avoid &quot;overdose&quot;.</p>

<p>Before taking a bath with sea salt Rinse under the shower. The required quantity of salt is dissolved in a liter of hot water, and then pour the solution into the water bath. You should select water temperature in the bath, it is comfortable for you, but remember that it should not be higher than 38 degrees. More hot water will dry the skin. In the water you can add your favorite essential oil or a decoction of herbs that enhance the action of the bath. Thus, essential oils of citrus fruits (lemon, orange, grapefruit) increase the effect of anti-cellulite treatments.</p>

<p>Immersed in the bath must not more than 10-20 minutes, at this region of the heart must remain above water. After the bath, you need to take a shower and put on a skin moisturizer. Then comes <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/body-wraps-for-weight-loss-belly/" title="wrap">wrapped</a> in a sheet or a bathrobe and sit or lie down quietly for half an hour. Within 1-2 hours before and after the bath should not eat, but you can drink green tea or herbal decoction.</p>

<p>Baths with sea salt are not for everyone, and have a list of contraindications. These include skin, heart and gynecological diseases, <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/vascular-disease/varicose-veins.html" title="varicose veins">varicose veins</a>, increased body temperature, the condition of alcoholic intoxication, <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/choosing-a-anti-stretch-marks-cream-after-giving-birth/" title="pregnancy">pregnancy</a>. If you have doubts about their safety for you personally, before the start of the procedures would be better to consult a doctor.</p>

<p>You can find a variety of opinions about the use of baths with sea salt. Among them there are also totally implausible: that someone has lost 10 kilograms in just a two weeks alone baths. To believe such statements are not worth it.</p>

<p>More than adequate people actually experienced the effects of sea salt, write to relieve fatigue and improve skin after these procedures. Weight is reduced by only a few kilograms in such baths combined with diet and physical activity. The achieved result is possible to keep under the same conditions.</p>

<p>From the available options in the sale of sea salt most people like the salt of the Dead Sea. Indeed, it has a unique chemical composition, wherein the proportion of sodium chloride accounts for only about 20%, and the remaining 80% - other minerals. Their relatively high content, and provides a more pronounced effect of water treatments.</p>

<p>Thus, a bath with sea salt should not be considered as the basis for weight loss, but rather as an aid provider cosmetic and soothing effect. But weight loss is still achieved a healthy diet and exercise, and do not expect that without them you can achieve noticeable results in the achievement of harmony.</p>
