<h2>Causes and Symptoms of fungal infections of nails and feet</h2>




<p>Ways of getting a lot of fungus in the body, you can catch anywhere, but most often it is on the beach, in the bath, in the pool, the sauna or the shoes of people infected.</p>




<p>Nail Fungus transmitted not only from person to person, but also from animals to humans, and from the external environment. Complicating the situation is that there is a great variety of mushrooms, more than 1.5 million of them are pathogenic to humans about 500 species.</p>




<p>Unfortunately, fungal infections do not produce immunity, and a person can be infected by the same form of the fungus many times. Fungi remarkably tenacious, as evidenced by the scientists conducted an unusual experiment &ndash; they put the shoes sick fungus man in a locker, and when 20 years later got her out of there, the spores of the fungus were fully viable. Therefore a crucial role in the fight against fungi plays prevention of fungal nail diseases and personal hygiene.</p>




<p>Mushrooms particularly active subject in humidity, heat and poor ventilation, and excessive use of soaps and detergents do not give that effect, which we expect hard observing hygiene. The fact that the surface of our skin has a protective, so-called lipid layer, the finest film of fat that they live in our &ldquo;native&rdquo; beneficial bacteria designed to protect us from the adverse effects of the environment.</p>




<p>Doctors do not recommend to wash with soap and water often, as when washing wool we literally rip off off this protective film, and a variety of micro-organisms, bacteria and fungi literally stick to our body without resistance, is not completely restore the natural cover, which takes about</p>




<p>An interesting scientific fact &ndash; in the 30-ies of the last century, during the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Chukchi, Evenki and other northern nations have become hard to teach hygiene, wash with soap making. The result was so unexpected that at first the doctors just shrugged and could not understand why Aboriginal started such a colossal death.</p>




<p>As it turned out later, soap destroying the protective layer of fat covering their skin and they were completely defenseless against the invasion of microorganisms. By the way, the researchers argue that it is for this same reason, and we often get sick after a bath, and not from the fact that hypothermia is commonly thought. Nature, as we know, did not know soap, the use of detergents &ndash; is a recent invention of European civilization. If you do not want to kill a cat or dog, do not wash them with soap or shampoo, because the animal can not live long in such a &ldquo;sterile&rdquo;.</p>




<p>If it affects the human fungal disease, first, as a rule, there are cracks between the toes and on the soles, and then passes the infection on your nails. It is believed that the fungus uncured stop sooner or later turns into a nail fungus from which escape is not so easy. Man begins to disturb the symptoms of fungal nail diseases &ndash; itching, discomfort and bad breath. Nail changes color becomes dull, opaque, crumbles, deformed, thickened. If the disease is not treated in time, the nail may collapse completely, and the fungus will eventually hit the nails on the hands.</p>




<p>If you do not fight the infection, the fungus begins to &ldquo;walk&rdquo; around the body, releasing toxins that affects the lymphatic and circulatory systems, reduces immunity and causes multiple allergies, sometimes even able to hit the brain. Man gets tired quickly, feel malaise, nausea, frequent colds.</p>




<h2>Prevention of fungal nail diseases</h2>




<p>Nail fungal disease is considered to be the surrender of immunity, so it is often susceptible to it people with weakened or immature immune, that is, children and the elderly. Considered a risk factor for various scratches, abrasions and other skin damage through which the fungus is easier to penetrate into the body, which are the gateway for incoming infections.</p>




<p>If you notice the first signs of fungal nail disease, such as discoloration of the nail, its transparency, thickening of the nail plate, an inflammation of the skin around the nail, as well as itching and redness between the toes, it is necessary without delay to see a doctor &ndash; dermatologist and deliver  The fungus is now successfully treated thanks to the arsenal of physicians in a large range of antifungal drugs. Most importantly, time to start treatment and prevent total capture of infection in your body.</p>




<p>If the affected area is small, it is often possible to cope with the fungus by local treatment. If the process of infection went away, then the treatment will be more time consuming, but, in any case, it should bring to an end, as the untreated fungus necessarily continue its destructive work. In the treatment of a family member, all others should also be examined, as most at risk of infection.</p>




<p>Better prevention of fungal infections of nails and feet &ndash; a thorough safety precautions to prevent re-infection. If you have been in a public bath and not too sure of its sterility, the best means of prevention is the treatment of foot boric alcohol or vinegar diluted as 1 tablespoon per cup of water, the media is detrimental to the fungus. Do not wear someone else&rsquo;s shoes, dry the feet, all the scratches and damage immediately treated with iodine or green paint.</p>




<p>When buying shoes, choose a spacious, comfortable, preferably made of natural materials and vented, because, as mentioned above, the fungus loves moist environment without air. Their shoes and do not forget to air regularly and periodically wipe the inside with a solution of vinegar, which kills germs, while leaving no odor.</p>




<p>If you nail fungal diseases is very important to strengthen your own immune system, destroyed the invasion of fungal infection.
