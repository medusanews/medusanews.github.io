<p>Gram prevention is worth pounds of hemorrhoid treatment.</p>

<p>And so, hemorrhoids easier to prevent than to cure. For this reason, you need to learn how to do therapeutic exercises for hemorrhoids.
The main group at risk are people sedentary work, drivers, and those who have digestive problems and constipation as a result.
Also, if you do not exercise, a little walk in the fresh air, or do not do, or at least some gymnastics.</p>

<p>What these exercises for hemorrhoids for you and need to learn to do them without fail.</p>

<h2>Physical therapy for hemorrhoids</h2>

<p>Lie on your back, bend your knees, the feet placed shoulder-width and not together, palm to rest on the floor, arms open. With a deep breath, lift your pelvis up straining buttocks, the load of the body at the same time try to tilt the chin, exhale down.</p>

<p>This exercise combines several medical factors, it is primarily changing the pressure in the chest, known as hemorrhoids is due to varicose veins.</p>

<p>Doing these movements by muscle tension during inspiration, the pressure in the chest falls, there is a siphon effect that helps drain blood from the abdominal cavity and thus to prevent the filling veins with blood.</p>

<p>The following exercises should be performed for hemorrhoids immediately after the first. Lying on his back legs to clasp his hands closer to his knees with his head on the floor, exhale, pull the knees to the chest lifting your buttocks off the floor, with inspiration to go back to the starting position. It is necessary to imagine that the back is glued to the tape to the floor and when you exhale you unstick it, and when inhaling glue the back. The chin is slightly pressed to stretched neck and his head is on the floor.</p>

<p>This therapeutic exercises for hemorrhoids is very useful for the reason that stimulates colonic motility, as is well known chronic constipation is one of the risk factors for which there is a hemorrhoid.</p>

<h2>Exercise therapy for hemorrhoids</h2>

<p>Sit down, place the palms shoulder-width apart, take steps back propped up on his toes, pelvis in the top position. Then pushing hard to breath hands and one leg to lift up, exhale on the lower, then the other leg, and so alternately.</p>

<p>Flip this situation improves venous drainage by gravity, the blood that used to work was to go up against the force of gravity, in this case very easily rushes toward the heart. And those varicose veins, which are in the pelvic area and are the basis for the emergence of hemorrhoids, they are fallen down. Accordingly, this leads to a reduction in pain symptoms in people who already have hemorrhoids, and in whom he had just run into.</p>

<h2>Time to preventive exercises</h2>

<p>10-15min and such exercises for hemorrhoids &ndash; this is what you can spend, so you did not have it. Also, do not forget that if you have a sedentary job, you also need to do a little every hour break, walking for a few minutes. At the weekend try as often as possible to visit the open air. And as his time Arnold Schwarzenegger said: &ldquo;Do periodically abdominal exercises abdominal and two months later his muscles will thank you&rdquo;.</p>
