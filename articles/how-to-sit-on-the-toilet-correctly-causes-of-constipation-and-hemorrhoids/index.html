Causes of constipation and hemorrhoids">&quot;How do we sit on the toilet?&quot; - once asked the author of the book &quot;Charming Bowel&quot;, at that time a student of the medical faculty, a neighbor in the apartment. The result of the answer to the question was the chapter in the book, which helped many people to take a fresh look at the process of defecation and get rid of <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/constipation.html" title="constipation">constipation</a> caused by psychological causes and wrong posture in the toilet.</p>

<p>The process of defecation is the result of well-coordinated work, in particular, two nervous systems. For this purpose, special adaptations and tricks have been developed by nature in our body.</p>

<p>It all starts with an incredibly well-designed system of locking mechanisms (or sphincters). Almost everyone is familiar only with the external locking mechanism, which by means of conscious impulses opens and closes. A similar locking mechanism is located a few centimeters above - it is beyond our control.</p>

<p>Once the brain decides about the disadvantage of the moment for going to the toilet, the outer locking mechanism obeys and closes as tightly as it can. The work of the internal locking mechanism is regulated <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/unconscious.html" title="unconsciously">unconsciously</a>. Aunt Berthe likes to fart or not, he is of little interest. Its priority is to maintain comfortable conditions inside the body. Gasses accumulate, which are pressed? All negative factors, the internal locking mechanism is inclined to lead out of the body as quickly as possible.</p>

<h2>How does it feel like to go to the toilet?</h2>

<p>Both locking mechanisms work hand in hand. When the waste of our <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/how-to-reduce-the-acidity-of-the-stomach/" title="digestion">digestion</a> approaches the internal locking mechanism, it opens up reflexively. Before all the contents are sent to the side of the external sphincter, the process of its testing takes place. In the space between the two locking mechanisms, a large number of sensitive cells are located, which analyze the information about the incoming contents: it is gaseous or solid in nature, and the information is sent to the brain. At this point, the brain forms a need like &quot;I want to go to the toilet&quot; or &quot;I want to fart&quot;.</p>

<p>Now the brain begins to converse with its consciousness: it is guided by what is happening around us at the moment, collecting and analyzing the information of our sight, hearing and already existing experience. In just a few seconds the brain has a complete picture and sends the data to the external locking device: &quot;I looked, we are here with Aunt Bertha in the living room. Fart still possible, but only if quietly. But to go to the toilet for a big need, perhaps, it is not necessary &hellip; not now&quot;.</p>

<p>The external locking mechanism takes received information and contracts even more tightly than before. The internal sphincter respects the decision taken by the colleague, and by joint decision the test sample is sent to the withdrawal queue.</p>

<p>After some time, the internal locking mechanism sends the test sample again to the evaluation. At this time we are already sitting at home, sitting comfortably on the couch: now you can!</p>

<h2>The cause of constipation is the containment of defecation</h2>

<p>Our inner locking mechanism is a stubborn comrade! His main postulate: &quot;What should come out, will be brought out&quot;. The external locking mechanism is in continuous contact with the outside world and constantly assesses: &quot;Will it be convenient to use another&rsquo;s toilet, or is it better not? If I do not go to the toilet now, I can do it only later in the evening, which means I&rsquo;ll have to feel uncomfortable all day long!&quot;.</p>

<p>If we keep ourselves from going to the toilet, suppressing the urge for the urge, then we oppress the work of the internal locking mechanism and as a result we can even damage it. The internal sphincter is in constant subordination to the external locking mechanism. And the more the external sphincter commands the inner sphincter, the higher the risk of development of problems and the appearance of constipation.</p>

<p>Conscious suppression of the natural processes occurring in the body should not be frequent, do not allow this to become a habit.</p>

<h2>How to sit on the toilet correctly?</h2>

<p>From time to time it is useful to review your habits and ask questions: &quot;Is the path to the stop I&rsquo;m going by is the shortest? Do I look more beautiful and modern when I comb my hair with a bald head? Or even this: &quot;Am I sitting right on the toilet?&quot;.</p>

<p>The last question is extremely difficult to get a clear, unambiguous answer. But, experimenting with yourself, you can bring some kind of novelty to the established process. The same opinion was shared by the Israeli doctor Dov Zikirov.</p>

<p>As part of his experiment, he observed an experienced group of 28 people who visited the toilet daily, taking one of the three poses:</p>

<ul>
<li>relaxing on a normal sized toilet bowl;</li>
<li>the same way, but sitting on a very small size toilet;</li>
<li>literally crouched or squatting, like in nature under a bush.</li>
</ul>


<p>At the same time the defecation time was recorded using a stopwatch, after which the questionnaires were filled.</p>

<p>The results were as follows: the act of defecation of the &quot;on nature&quot; type took an average of 50 seconds, the subjects after emptying in such a pose described their condition as &quot;a feeling of complete emptying&quot;. Sitting in the usual pose, the process lasted for an average of 130 seconds and subjective sensations lagged behind the first group of subjects.</p>

<h2>Why the posture &quot;under the bush&quot; is better for defecation</h2>

<p>The fact is that our locking device is designed in such a way that when we are in a sitting position, it can not open completely. There is a muscle that covers the rectum with a loop like a lasso, when we are in a sitting or standing position, as a result of this action, a bend is formed. Such a mechanism is complementary to existing muscular blocking devices. You can draw an analogy with the bend of the hose for irrigation. If you quickly spread the formed inflection, after a few seconds the water starts to beat again with a key.</p>

<p>Due to the blocking bend in the rectum, the locking sphincters, when we are in a standing and sitting position, exert less effort to contain the movement of fecal masses within the body. As soon as the muscle changes position and ceases to affect the intestine, it is eliminated by the hall, and the path is free.</p>

<p>The squatting position is an evolutionary, natural position of our body in the process of defecation.</p>

<p>The modern position of sitting became a habit with the appearance of toilet bowls in the premises at the end of the XVIII century. But the explanation of the type &quot;caveman is always &hellip;&quot; is a somewhat problematic argument for physicians. Who said that in the squatting position, the muscles relax in such a way that unobstructed movement along the intestine is ensured? And here the Japanese scientists to study this issue gave the group of subjects, along with food, substrates containing labeled substances, and during the defecation in various positions, they were followed by X-ray equipment.</p>

<ul>
<li>Conclusion No. 1. Indeed, in the squat position, the intestinal canal accepts a straight trajectory and there is an unobstructed rapid emptying of the rectal cavity.</li>
<li>Conclusion No. 2. Yet there are altruists who friendlyly agreed to absorb labeled substrates and allowed to lead the observation during such a delicate matter as defecation!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Constipation, hemorrhoids and pose in the toilet</h2>

<p><a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/factors-of-hemorrhoids/" title="hemorrhoids">Hemorrhoids</a>, intestinal pathologies and constipation are phenomena prevalent mainly in countries where bowel evacuation occurs as a &quot;sitting on a chair&quot; type. The reason for this, especially in young people, is not weak musculature, but just increased pressure on the intestines. The development of hemorrhoids, which are prominent from the cavity of the rectum, is one of the mechanisms of compensating for increased internal pressure in the abdominal cavity.</p>

<p>1.2 billion people, accustomed to cope with the need of squatting, do not suffer from hemorrhoids of the intestine. The more developed part of mankind, tiring every day, sooner or later faces problems, for the solution of which it is sent to a specialist. Is it really the payoff for a comfortable seat on the toilet seat instead of coping with an unusual way of sitting-squatting? But if only that!</p>

<p>Physicians are unanimous in the opinion that frequent tension of the abdominal wall and stiffness in the toilet are one of the reasons for the development of <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/vascular-disease/varicose-veins.html" title="varicose veins">varicose veins</a>. In addition, the risk of developing <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/stroke.html" title="stroke">strokes</a> increases and even there are cases of loss of consciousness during defecation.</p>

<p>One day from a friend who was vacationing in France, I received a text message: &quot;The French have gone mad! Someone was stealing the toilet bowls right along three parking lots!&quot;. At first I laughed, because I thought that he was not serious. And then I remembered my first visit to France and how, for the first time, when I saw the toilet without a seat, I was thinking to myself with a longing for the hole in the floor: &quot;Excuse me, please, why I should squat when it would be more logical to put an ordinary toilet bowl&quot;.</p>

<p>In case of difficulty in the process of defecation, it is recommended to create a convenient angle for the sphincters of sphincters - to accept the squatting position.</p>

<p>In most of the Asian countries, countries of Africa and South America, people are in need of the pose of a weightlifter lifting a barbell or a skier at the next turn. We, on the contrary, spend time blissfully on the toilet, while simultaneously reading the newspaper, folding origami from toilet paper or just patiently looking at the opposite wall.</p>

<p>When I read this text to my home, I watched the confused glances in which I saw: &quot;And what now, to refuse the faience flasks, to make a hole in the floor and to put the need there?&quot;. Of course not! It turns out that you can change the position of the muscle and sitting on the toilet in the usual way. The following recommendation is especially useful if the relief of the need is carried out with varying difficulties. That&rsquo;s what you need to do: the upper part of the body slightly tilts forward, under the feet we put a low stand - and voila! - the right angle is found. Now you can read the newspaper with a calm heart, play toilet paper or look at the surrounding objects!</p>
