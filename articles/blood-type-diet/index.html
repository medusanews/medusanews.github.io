Adamo, has received wide popularity around the world because it helps not only lose weight but also to normalize the body&rsquo;s metabolism, prevent the development of various diseases and provide excellent health.</p>

<h2>The essence of the blood type diet</h2>

<p>The essence of the blood type diet is that people with different blood types genetically incorporated different digestibility of the same products. Author of the procedure have noticed that, for example, recommended by many nutritionists, vegetarian diets are yielding positive results are not everything &ndash; for some people, they are not only useless, but also significantly impair the health.</p>

<p>In fact, his research has shown that some of the products that can help a person lose weight with one type of blood may even be harmful for people with another type. It is because of incorrectly matched individual menus, according to Dr. D&#8217;Adamo, a person gets fat, sick, and does damage to your health.</p>

<p>Since weight gain is usually the result of disturbances in the body metabolism, correctly made diet excludes from the diet is the foods that are toxic to a particular person, poorly digested and can not be absorbed. Thus, the blood type diet, eliminating &ldquo;harmful&rdquo; foods, helps to not only lose weight but also to cleanse the toxins that are known to be deposited in the fat depots. In addition, natural food products that corresponds to the type of blood heals entire gastro &ndash; intestinal tract and allergies disappear.</p>

<h2>The Evolution of blood types</h2>

<p>The Evolution of blood types (from first to fourth) took place gradually over the centuries as a result of adaptation of digestive and immune system to changing environmental conditions. Thus, the first type of blood is the most &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; and initially all the people on Earth were its owners. In those days, they focused solely on hunting, eating meat of dead animals (protein food), so their digestive system was ideally suited for its digestion.</p>

<p>The fourth type appeared relatively recently (about 1500 years ago) as a result of the mixing of the second and third types, and she is very rare and occurs only in 5% of the population.</p>

<p>Based on this classification, Dr. Peter D&#8217;Adamo were developed separate recommendations for weight loss and maintenance of health for all four varieties:</p>

<h2>Blood type diet of the first (type 0)</h2>

<p>Representatives of the first type (33% of the population) are natural carnivores genetically, they have increased the acidity of gastric juice, so that protein foods quickly and fully recycled and not deposited as fat. Therefore, the basis of 0 blood type diet should be lean meat (except pork and goose) &ndash; at least 5-6 times a week, fish and seafood. It is also very useful seaweed, liver, greens, lettuce, spinach, radish, radish, broccoli.</p>

<p>Due to the high acidity of the gastric juice of people with first blood often suffer from gastric ulcer, intestinal disorders and allergies, as the mucous membranes eventually begin to ulcerate. Therefore, blood type diet first should include vegetables and fruits, which have an alkaline reaction.</p>

<p>Include vegetables such properties are artichoke, cauliflower, broccoli, artichoke, onion, garlic, parsley, horseradish, parsnips, spinach and beet leaves. Of fruit is recommended to include in the diet of prunes, figs, plums, dark cherries, as well as lemon and grapefruit, which show an alkaline reaction in the stomach, despite its sour taste.</p>

<p>A from the strawberries, oranges, tangerines and strawberries should be abandoned, as these fruits excessively increase the acidity of gastric juice. The same recommendations apply to vegetable and fruit juices, beverages and condiments. Absolutely contraindicated in cabbage and apple juice, black tea, coffee, and ketchup, vinegar and mayonnaise, which are the enemies of the stomach acidity. It is recommended to drink plenty of water, green tea decoction of rose hips, peppermint and lime.</p>

<p>Dairy products should be used with caution, because the body is not adapted to their full absorption. For example, whole milk and processed cheese should be excluded altogether, as yogurt, low-fat sour cream and yogurt can be included in the menu is not more than 1-2 times a week. Eggs are a valuable source of protein can be eaten 3-4 times a week, but not more than 1 piece per day.</p>

<h2>Blood type diet second (type A)</h2>

<p>Blood type diet second includes mainly fresh and natural plant products (mainly cereals and vegetables), because the digestive system of people of type A is ideally suited for the use of vegetarian food and very poorly digested and absorbed by meat and dairy products. For example, dairy products, especially whole milk, inhibit the metabolism in the body and causes multiple allergic reactions, and therefore they should be replaced by soy or milk.</p>

<p>Because of the low acidity, characteristic of this type of people, their stomach can not digest meat, so its use contributes to the deposition of fat and a slower metabolism. So if you can not completely eliminate it from the diet, limit consumption of chicken or turkey, but rather go on unsalted fish, such as perch, carp, cod, trout, sardines or mackerel. In addition, because of delicate mucous membrane of the stomach should be excluded from the menu spicy and salty foods, sausages and smoked meat, pepper, vinegar, ketchup, mayonnaise, spices, sour fruits and berries, potatoes.</p>

<p>The source of protein in type A should be soy products, eggs and cheese. As you can eat unlimited amounts of whole cereal grains (except wheat), vegetables (except potatoes, tomatoes, olives and eggplant), fruits (except bananas, which are high in calories and too heavy for digestion) and legumes, which are useful to pre-germinate. Salads dressed with olive desirable or linseed oil, and the use of rye bread or on a wheat germ.</p>

<p>Very useful vegetable and fruit juices, such as apricots, cherries, plums, carrots, grapefruit, pineapple and celery. In addition, to prevent the causes of constipation and remove mucus from the intestines is recommended to drink plenty of water (at least two liters a day) and drink every morning on an empty stomach a glass of warm water with the juice of freshly squeezed lemon.</p>

<p>The people of type A is usually a weak immune system open to all infections, sensitive and delicate digestive tract, as well as the increased sensitivity of the nervous system. They often suffer from heart diseases and cancer, as well as tend to pathologies of the gallbladder, liver and symptoms of type 1 diabetes. For them, the recommended diet for a second type of blood is extremely important, because in vegetarian diet immune and digestive system will work more efficiently and be able to prevent the emergence of symptoms of gallstone disease and other serious illnesses.</p>
