How to determine the degree of obesity?" alt="abdominal obesity, abdominal adiposity, visceral obesity">Obesity is a disease in which the body weight is increased by increasing the content of fatty tissue. Besides the obvious harm to health (people with its presence will develop diabetes, <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/atherosclerosis.html" title="atherosclerosis">atherosclerosis</a> and other disorders), the disease significantly spoils the appearance, worsening and even disfiguring figure.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the term &quot;<a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="obesity">obesity</a>&quot; means a pathology, this word is unpleasant, is clearly negative, to some extent condemneth group. Naturally, neither one nor the other owners do not like excess weight, which often prefer to call his lack of completeness, obesity, but not this definition. However, there is a way to dot the &quot;i&quot;: some simple calculations help to distinguish the fullness of obesity.</p>

<h2>What is BMI and what is it for?</h2>

<p>On the body mass index (BMI), we have repeatedly said in other posts, devoted to <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/gone-month-after-weight-loss-how-to-restore-the-month-following-the-diet/" title="weight loss">weight loss</a>. It refers to the ratio of height and weight, which is expressed by a numerical value and gives an indication of normal, insufficient or overweight humans. It calculated it is very simple: the value of the body weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.</p>

<h2>More clearly this can be represented as follows:</h2>

<p>The normal value of the index in women vary in the region from 19 to 25. The difference between these figures is large enough that allows index capture growth-weight ratios in people of any stature. For this reason and asthenics fragile and strong hypersthenics have at its mass index &quot;fit&quot; into the gap from 19 to 25. If the resulting number is greater than the upper limit, it is clearly talking about excess weight and justification of the mighty physique and broad bone this case untenable.</p>

<p>To make it easier to navigate in the calculations, we give an example. Take the girl with above average growth of 170 cm and weighing 60 kg, and calculate her BMI.</p>

<p>Thus, a person with such parameters do not suffer deficiency and excess weight. Unfortunately, some can only envy like&hellip; And now, when we have understood the basics, let&rsquo;s go further.</p>

<p>There are many ways to define obesity and its powers, of which we give only the most used. However, regardless of what kind of degree is awarded this disorder, obesity must be fought. However, many Americans do not agree with us. In the US, there is even a special thick society; once a certain time, its members come from different cities and states, arrange meetings and meetings to teach &quot;newbies&quot; that being overweight - this is normal, and we must love themselves as they are. We will not challenge the right of others to their own opinion, but remain at its European convictions <strong>obesity - it is not the norm, and the disease that it is necessary to get rid of.</strong></p>

<h2>Determining the degree of obesity by BMI. Method one</h2>

<p>In this case, the degree is determined depending on the body mass index.</p>

<ul>
<li>BMI of 19-25 is the norm;</li>
<li>BMI of 25-30 indicates a &quot;pre-obese&quot; - increased body weight, which is necessary to normalize;</li>
<li>BMI of 30-35 corresponds to the first degree of obesity;</li>
<li>BMI of 35-40 speaks of the second degree;</li>
<li>BMI above 40 indicates the presence of third-degree obesity.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see, would be considered our hypothetical woman slim, if not weighed 60 and 90 kilograms.</p>

<p>The result - the first degree. As you can see, this method is quite liberal, because even at much lower weight, people often consider themselves full and try to get rid of the extra kilos to look like the most aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<h2>Determining the degree of obesity. Method two</h2>

<p>The second method is to determine overweight relative to the norm in percentage is used much less frequently than the first.</p>

<p>If &quot;preponderance&quot; is not more than 10%, it is not obese and completion. With an excess of 10-29% are diagnosed with &quot;1 degree of obesity&quot;, with 30-49% - the second degree, at 50% and more - the third degree.</p>

<p>For example, initially the girl, which in our example &quot;recovered&quot; from 60 to 90 kg, had asthenic constitution, that is, the notorious 60 kg were her ideal weight. Calculate how much it exceeded its weight &quot;limit&quot; when the stout up to 90 kg. Let us remember and construct elementary arithmetic proportion, although, in principle, you can make calculations in mind.</p>

<p>X = 150%, that is excess relatively normal weight is 50%.</p>

<p>The result - our &quot;guinea&quot; came to the last, third-degree obesity! It turns out, the use of different methods give very different results&hellip; What does this mean? Only that <strong>ideal system for determining the degree of obesity does not exist, and the calculations are made to give only approximate figures.</strong></p>

<p>In fact, it is very difficult to put on the same level with people very different physique, height, shape and features, etc., and provide a single formula for all. At the present time to determine the presence of obesity and its degrees are the first of the designated ways, but objectively can hardly be considered the ideal. Imagine yourself: well, how can not very tall woman weighing 90 kg be considered &quot;little&quot; full?</p>

<p>However, morality is not in it. We will not complain about the errors of the individual formulas, as well as distressed relative imperfection of the health system and the structure of the world as a whole. We draw attention to something else: thinking about the state of the figure, do not indulge in the calculations and determine how many kilograms you can without remorse &quot;eat&quot; that is not officially regarded as a thick. Control yourself: honest look in the mirror will tell you much more than any arithmetic, it will show you your weaknesses will help you plan activities and then when you are prefer to allow a joy to watch the progress. And then you will cease to care about the issue, there you are overweight or not: You will continuously work on ourselves and better understand that the main thing - not the absence of too full hips or too wide waist, which can be just your feature and exercise, a relief, the harmony of the entire body.</p>
