<p>Sodium is the main component of salt is a natural mineral that is found in many foods, but most of it gets to us it is in the form of salt - the well-known compounds <em>NaCl</em>, are sure that the label of &quot;white death&quot;. Why is this connection is maintained for such a bad reputation?</p>

<p>The fact is that sodium is the main extracellular ion rights, without which it is impossible to imagine the course of normal metabolic processes. Sodium, making the main contribution to the maintenance of osmotic pressure of the blood, thereby causes fluid retention in the bloodstream, and when excessive amounts causes an increase in blood volume and, consequently, an increase in blood pressure.</p>

<p>Manufacturers often added salt in packaged foods as a preservative which increases their lifespan. Restaurants also added a large amount of salt in prepared foods to improve taste. According to doctors at the <em>Cleveland Clinic</em>, the addition of sodium in foods is often the culprit spikes in blood pressure and, as a consequence, the emergence of hypertensive crises. Some examples of foods that are high in sodium, which contribute to high blood pressure: deli meats, sausage, bacon, ham, instant soups, broths, marinades, sauces, including soy sauce, ketchup, chips, popcorn, salted nuts, salted seafood to beer, and pickled.</p>

<p>According to numerous scientific data reduction of salt in the diet leads to a sustainable reduction in blood pressure. It is recommended to use less than 5 grams (5000 mg) of salt a day, but if you already have any disease of the cardiovascular system, then you are limiting the content of salt in the diet should be at a level of no more than 1500 mg, which is significantly less than in the previous recommendations. For orientation, one teaspoon of salt contains about 2400 milligrams of sodium.</p>

<p>Excessive alcohol consumption blood pressure can rise to dangerous levels. Dr. Sheldon Sheps of the Mayo Clinic says that drinking more than three doses of conventional alcoholic drinks temporarily raises blood pressure, while recurring binges can cause high blood pressure for a long time. Understanding how much alcohol you consume, is already an important step in reducing the habit; per conventional dose of alcohol is considered to be 350 ml beer, 140 ml of wine or 40 ml of the 40-degree vodka.</p>

<p>It was found that people who follow a diet high in fat, have higher blood pressure than vegetarians. In contrast, a study published in April 1987 in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine suggests that a diet high in fiber and high in polyunsaturated fats is able to keep blood pressure low. In addition, many fruits and vegetables contain potassium, known for its action for lowering blood pressure.</p>

<p><strong>Here we consider a number of foods that can help lower blood pressure:</strong></p>

<p>Vegetables - provide the body with magnesium, potassium and fiber, which are important nutrients that can reduce blood pressure. Be sure to eat a variety of vegetables daily, including broccoli, potatoes, spinach, cabbage, tomatoes and zucchini. If you consume vegetable juice, make sure it does not have a high sodium content.</p>

<p><em>Fruits</em> - choose a variety of fruits to help meet your needs for magnesium, potassium and fiber. Bananas, apples, berries, melons, peaches, pineapple and citrus fruits are good choices. Eat fruits daily. If you choose a fruit juice, make sure that there is enough plant fiber and low in sugar (ie, preference should be given exactly the juice, not nectar).</p>

<p><em>Dairy Products</em> - it has been shown that calcium is contained in dairy products, it is effective in reducing blood pressure in persons suffering from hypertension. Dairy products are a rich source of calcium, including it relates to milk, cheese and low-fat yoghurt.</p>

<p><em>Whole grains</em> - mainly contain vegetable fiber (cellulose), which can also help reduce blood pressure. Therefore, enter in your diet of brown rice, whole grains, bran cereal, cereal and bread based on barley and oats.</p>

<p><em>Fish</em> - even if the fish is fat, but it contains a lot of omega-3 fatty acids - such as in salmon, it is a very positive effect on the cardiovascular system in general has a definite hypotensive effect. The American Heart Association offers a variety of foods to eat fish twice a week.</p>

<p><em>Nuts</em>, legumes and seeds are a rich source of fiber, energy, protein and magnesium, which also has a hypotensive action. So try to periodically use almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, peanuts, sunflower seeds or pumpkin.</p>

<p><em>Spices</em> - to eat less food with salt (i.e., less salt food), try to diversify its nutritional quality of a variety of spices to give the food a unique new fragrance.</p>
