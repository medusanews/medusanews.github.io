    <id>http://medusanews.com/articles/get-rid-of-allergies-forever-causes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/get-rid-of-allergies-forever/image.jpg" width="200" height="150" title="Get rid of allergies forever, pathogenic microflora of the intestine, causes of allergies" alt="Get rid of allergies forever. The causes of allergies"> Of allergy contributes to the pathogenic intestinal microflora. Scientists around the world are studying the causes of allergies, because in the last few decades, the world has seen a rapid increase in allergic diseases and according to WHO every fifth child is born with allergies. Allergies &ndash; is an individual reaction to certain substances (allergens) after contact with them.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The causes of allergies and current treatments</h2>

<p>In parallel with the increasing number of allergies and a list of allergens, which began to get even the most innocent-looking substance. Currently, there are so many new allergens that to protect itself from them, and to exclude from your diet and environment is not possible. Allergic reactions can cause food, household dust, pollen and plant fluff, pet hair, cosmetics, medicines and much more.</p>

<p>Allergy symptoms in different people as diverse &ndash; coughing, sneezing, snot, itching, rash on the body, swelling of the mucous membranes and even asthma. In severe cases, anaphylactic shock can occur &ndash; the most dangerous manifestation of allergic reaction, which in the absence of immediate medical attention to result in death. If there are signs of anaphylactic shock, such as seizures, loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, vomiting, rash all over the body, involuntary urination and defecation, you should immediately call an ambulance.</p>

<p>Modern drugs, widely advertised in the media, unfortunately, do not eliminate the causes of the emergence and development of allergies, and are directed only by addressing its symptoms and relief of the patient. Allergy treatment passes through the standard procedure &ndash; first samples are taken to establish the allergen in order to avoid contact with him, and then assigned to an antihistamine and immune-boosting drugs. But this approach can not be considered the treatment because the treatment of any disease it is important to establish the root cause that caused it, and fix it.</p>

<p>Also popular method of treatment of specific immunotherapy (SIT), the essence of which is the regular administration of low doses of a specific allergen with a gradual increase, which stimulates the immune system and leads to a resistance to it. SIT prolonged treatment and more efficient &ndash; reducing the need for medications the patient, the symptoms are greatly reduced, which is especially important in asthma attacks. SIT is a basic treatment of asthma, by which it is possible to achieve a prolonged remission.</p>

<p>The method is definitely more effective than the simple application of antihistamines, but the downside of it is that in allergic reaction rarely occurs on a single allergen. Most of several allergens and their number increases with time. Develop immunity to any one allergen, the body begins to react to the new stuff, and so on to infinity, because the cause of allergies is still not resolved.</p>

<h2>Get rid of the allergy will forever intestinal microflora</h2>

<p>Scientists still can not name the exact cause of the allergy, why the same adverse environmental and technological conditions in some relatively healthy people cause allergies and others do not. But already found exactly what one of the main causes of allergies is to reduce the number of beneficial microflora in the gut colonization and its pathogenic microbes is called dysbiosis (dysbiosis).</p>

<p>Many people underestimate the lack of knowledge of the role of beneficial microflora for normal body function. Useful healthy human intestinal flora consists of 2-3 kg microorganisms which produce fiber of a variety of vitamins, hormones, amino acids, enzymes, hemoglobin and improve immunity, promote good assimilation of iron. In addition, the intestinal microflora and neutralizes harmful pathogens.</p>

<p>If a person prevails in the gut microflora useful, it copes with its tasks. If the number of beneficial microflora is reduced, which most often occurs with antibiotic treatment, it took place immediately pathogenic bacteria that without meeting resistance, are beginning to multiply, causing inflammation of the gastro &ndash; intestinal tract.</p>

<p>Then begin to destroy pathogenic microflora integrity of the intestinal mucosa, and decreases its protective barrier function, whereby allergens and toxins may enter freely into the body. In addition, pathogenic microflora begins to actively produce histamine and other substances promoting the development of allergy. Therefore, doctors have long known rule that the cure is dysbiosis, and allergic reactions immediately back down, appearing less frequently or disappear completely.</p>

<p>Dysbacteriosis contributes not only to the emergence of symptoms of allergies, but also metabolic disorders, cardiovascular and endocrine diseases and even depression. Scientists have found a clear link between the presence of dysbiosis and the level of anxiety a person who at dysbiosis increased almost 3 times. And the fact that the problems with the skin, hair and nails can not be removed any creams and cosmetics, without solving the problem of dysbiosis, long time it is not a secret.</p>

<p>Therefore, it can be said without exaggeration that the intestinal microflora is the key to the health of the body and each person has to take care of her, not only to get rid of all allergies, but also to avoid the many other diseases. For this it is necessary to organize your diet to a diet rich in plant-dominated fiber and fiber products, especially vegetables, fruits, cereals from whole grains, bran bread, and milk products.</p>

<p>If you want to be healthy, in any case, do not overeat, start a one-day fasting yourself to help the body as excess food is not digested and starts to rot in the gut, poisoning it. German physician Max Gerson, a lifetime studying the dependence of cancer from power in his book &ldquo;The treatment of cancer,&rdquo; says that in his research of 10,000 cancer cases, only one came from irreversible changes in the body, and all the rest of 9999 are the result of poisoning their own</p>

<p>If you regularly take care of the purity of his bowel and healthy nutrition necessary for the beneficial microflora, then not only will get rid of allergies, but in the future and avoid many serious diseases.</p>

    <updated>2013-12-02T20:53:00+06:00</updated>
    <id>http://medusanews.com/articles/diseases-of-the-thyroid-gland</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/thyroid-disease-hypothyroidism/image.jpg" width="200" height="150" title="Thyroid disease, hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism symptoms, hyperthyroidism causes, hyperthyroidism symptoms" alt="Diseases of the thyroid gland. Causes and symptoms of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism"> Thyroid disorders require prompt diagnosis and treatment. Thyroid gland without reason called the small conductor of a large orchestra, emphasizing that at small sizes (at a rate of about 15-20 grams), it plays a vital role in directing the overall operation of the complex formation as the human body.</p>

<p>It is the most important part of a complex human endocrine system, along with the pituitary gland, adrenal glands, pancreas, thymus gland and gonads.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>These glands produce and secrete into the blood of about 50 types of hormones. The thyroid gland produces only two kinds of hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), but no! With their help, it regulates the body&rsquo;s metabolism, the cardiovascular and central nervous system, and manages the psycho &ndash; emotional and sexual activity.</p>

<p>It is up to the thyroid gland depends on the psycho-emotional state of a person, that is, whether he is irritable, aggressive, quick-tempered and ready at any moment to lose self-control, or, conversely, apathetic, passive and indifferent to everything.</p>

<p>From these two hormones depends on body temperature, heart rate, the rate of burning calories and more. A healthy body produces these hormones for as long as necessary for the proper function. But, for failures of the thyroid gland, the necessary hormones starts to be produced more or less the norm, which is equally bad.</p>

<h2>The causes and symptoms of hypothyroidism</h2>

<p>Causes of hypothyroidism &ndash; reduced function of the thyroid gland, in which hormone production becomes insufficient, which is manifested lethargy, apathy, drowsiness, chilliness, fatigue, decreased immunity and slowing metabolism. The main symptoms of hypothyroidism, which should pay close attention &ndash; the appetite is reduced, but the weight increases, performance decreases bowel, constipation appear also thinner nails, they appear grooves and thickening.</p>

<p>Hypothyroidism begins quietly, and all of these symptoms, you see, we are usually easy to explain to stress, fatigue and tiredness. Instead check your thyroid hormone levels and normalize metabolism, sit on a diet, the result of which will not, and harm to an unbalanced diet, typical of nearly all diets, we currently add.</p>

<p>The main causes of hypothyroidism, according to doctors &ndash; an inflammation of the thyroid gland, thyroid congenital anomalies, of her injury, radiation exposure, lack of function of the pituitary hormones, multiple surgeries and a lack of iodine in the body. Doctors are advised to adjust your diet so that the table is always present iodine-containing foods such as seaweed, sea fish, citrus fruits, beets, potatoes, tomatoes.</p>

<p>Most of iodine contained in seaweed and fish products in the rest of his relatively few. But it is worth noting that all is good in moderation, and foods containing iodine, is also not be abused. For example, now so popular Japanese dish, like rolls, contain too much iodine, because it uses algae, which can negatively affect the thyroid gland.  Therefore, doctors are advised to eat no more than 2-3 rolls a week.</p>

<h2>The causes and symptoms of hyperthyroidism</h2>

<p>The symptoms and causes of hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism are opposite, because in this disease the thyroid gland begins to produce hormones more than the norm and its function increases. The main symptoms of hyperthyroidism &ndash; a person loses weight rapidly, experiencing constant hunger, frequent diarrhea, becomes irritable, aggressive, his trembling fingers and eyelids appear the most frequent symptoms of hypertension &ndash; heart palpitations and high blood pressure.</p>

<p>In addition, hyperthyroidism is often a major cause of insomnia and dangerous complications of pregnancy. Pregnancy in hyperthyroidism requires mandatory compensation of the disease, because the excess hormones affect the fetus is extremely toxic and may cause his death, and various deformities.</p>

<p>Also in patients with hyperthyroidism often appears so-called &ldquo;exophthalmia&rdquo;, which creates additional problems of cosmetic nature and are often complex.</p>

<p>According to the eminent physician and scientist Botkin, the main causes of hyperthyroidism &ndash; neuro-psychiatric disorders, depression, and emotional breakdowns that disrupt the function of the thyroid gland. Hyperthyroidism is often referred to as a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; illness singers and artists because their work forces to be always &ldquo;on edge&rdquo;, a state of stress. In many patients, the disease was the primary cause psychological trauma, along with unfavorable heredity.</p>

<p>Not for nothing now, many doctors before diagnosis, are asked to make thyroid ultrasound and donate blood on hormones, because the root of many diseases lies in deviations in the thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are equally dangerous and need to see a doctor because if left untreated, these symptoms not only persist, but eventually amplified.</p>

<p>If the processing of any scratches with iodine you find traces of iodine disappear quickly (for example, for lubrication in the evening &ndash; no traces in the morning), it is likely iodine in your body is missing. And if you are, in addition, in his notice listed in this article symptoms of thyroid disease, be sure to turn in at the first opportunity blood on hormones, particularly TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone). This analysis is absolutely show, do you have any thyroid disease.</p>

<p>If there are any deviations in the analysis, then do not panic, do not be afraid to seek medical attention. Believe me, the thyroid gland is not afraid, afraid of the consequences when people are not treated. Do not be afraid &ldquo;terrible&rdquo; words hormones, having heard horror stories of incompetent people. The hormone thyroxine, which is prescribed to drink in low thyroid function, consists of only 4 atoms of iodine &ndash; as you may see, it is not, it is completely harmless.</p>

<p>Endocrinologists also argue that the more and more people nervous, the more strained his thyroid. So, do not bring your health to a critical state, all you need &ndash; to protect the nerves and the nerves of your loved ones and receive regular medical examinations, thereby maintaining their health.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/foods-that-thin-blood/image.jpg" width="200" height="150" title="Diet for varicose veins, blood thinning products, foods that thin blood, varicose veins diet" alt="Diet products for varicose blood thinning and foods that thin blood"> Diet for varicose thins the blood and improves venous blood flow. Proper nutrition and therapeutic diet for varicose plays a huge role in the treatment and prevention of disease, as it allows not only to reduce excess weight, thereby significantly reducing the burden on travmatiruyuschuyu diseased veins, but also by good selection of food, thin out the blood and significantly improve.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>For the prevention of varicose veins is first necessary to eliminate the risk factors that create additional pressure on the venous system, the most damaging of which are the extra pounds. The more overweight a person is thicker than the subcutaneous layer of fat, the greater the pressure exerted on the blood vessel wall that is not made of concrete.</p>

<p>This is why people who are overweight, even without overt signs of varicose veins is strictly forbidden to lift weights over 5 pounds, as an additional burden on the lifted weight greatly increases the pressure on the blood vessels and worsens their condition until critical.</p>

<h2>Diet for varicose veins</h2>

<p>Diet for varicose veins is designed to restore proper nutrition, promotes the normalization of weight and transpose blood clotting &ndash; a major risk of varicose veins.</p>

<p>As you know, in varicose veins the blood becomes thick and viscous, causing blood particles &ldquo;stick together&rdquo; to form clots in various parts of the body, usually in the groin, behind the knees and calves, which is a very dangerous condition. The high viscosity of the blood increases the risk of blood clots in the blood vessels and the heart, so the task of thinning it is of paramount importance.</p>

<p>Hemodilution contributes not only diet but also enough drinking regime, as blood is 90% of the water. According to doctors, all vascular patients drink too little of plain water, but for them it is a matter of life and death, especially in the heat. It was in the heat dramatically increases the number of heart attacks and strokes &ndash; a person sweats, loses a lot of moisture, and the vessels are much narrower and the blood thickens.</p>

<p>Therefore, to make the body physiological costs and ensure the usefulness of metabolic processes, you need to drink daily for at least 2 &ndash; 2.5 liters of good quality water &ndash; this is the first natural remedy for thinning the blood, which is always at hand. When used as a dirty, chlorinated water or unstructured body expends a lot of energy at the intracellular level, to transform it.</p>

<p>In addition to water, you can drink green or mint tea and natural fruit and vegetable juices. Especially useful for varicose veins are considered juice from red grapes, lemon, orange, tomato, cranberry and any sour grapes. From beer and alcohol should be avoided, as they are diuretic foods that contribute to dehydration and thickening of blood.</p>

<p>This thickened blood thinners for its active physicians prescribe drugs aspirin because it contains salicylic acid (vitamin C), according to research scientists, not only substantially reduces the viscosity of the blood, but also reduces the workload on the heart muscle and reduces the risk of cardiac and  But all is not rosy as it might seem at first glance. Permissible safe therapeutic dose of aspirin should not exceed 75-100 mg per day, and the excess of it, not only negates the positive effect, but also leads to the opposite result &ndash; the incessant nosebleeds to fatal internal blood loss.</p>

<p>Increasing the dose of aspirin leads to sweatshops effect and blood clots. Therefore, independent, without a doctor&rsquo;s prescription, taking aspirin for the &ldquo;prevention&rdquo; rather than sin in recent years, many people, eating handfuls of it, is totally unacceptable. In addition, it should be noted that aspirin, even intravenous use, very aggressive effect on the digestive tract and cause erosion and ulcers in the stomach wall.</p>

<h2>Foods that thin blood</h2>

<p>Forming the diet menu for varicose veins, you know that there are natural products that contribute to thinning the blood better than aspirin &ndash; they who must always be present on your desktop. For example, a few spoonfuls of raspberry jam, in its effect replace aspirin. And vice versa &ndash; the foods that thin blood, should be possible to eliminate from your diet.</p>

<p>Of vascular doctors generally advise patients to hang in a prominent place in the kitchen are two lists &ndash; the &ldquo;white&rdquo; list of foods and blood thinners &ldquo;black&rdquo; list of banned products, which it is concentrated and strictly check with them their food. After all, our health, by and large, had read it to the dinner table and each product has its own power supply &ldquo;chemistry&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Diet for varicose veins should primarily be aimed at improving the work of the liver, as in all patients varices, deviations in its work. Do not forget that the liver is called the chemical laboratory of the body &ndash; it is responsible for all metabolic processes and generates the necessary substances that prevent blood clots. If the liver is healthy, then the formation of clots in blood vessels, in principle, impossible. But, unfortunately, poor environment, poor diet, alcohol, drugs and an abundance of forcing her to work at full capacity.</p>

<p>Therefore, proper nutrition with varicose veins should be as restrictive of the liver, you need to limit fats, meats, pickles, preserves, sausages, meat broth, jelly, cream and white bread. In addition to the &ldquo;black list&rdquo; of foods that thin blood, are bananas, mango, rose, lentils, walnuts, chokeberry, aronia juice and pomegranate.</p>

<p>A list of useful products, blood thinners, big enough &ndash; flaxseed and olive oil, fish and fish oil, tomato juice, apple cider vinegar, lemons, grapefruit, sunflower seeds, chocolate, cocoa, beets, berries (raspberries, cranberries, blueberries, strawberries,  Regular use of garlic in food, according to research by scientists, is capable of existing clots sucked in half, so try to regularly introduce garlic to your diet.</p>

<p>Additionally, the menu should include products containing magnesium, which inhibits the formation of blood clots. A lot of magnesium is found in oatmeal, oat flour, oatmeal and ginger.</p>

<p>As for herbs, patients with varicose veins should be taken to use them with great caution, as the grass &ndash; it is a serious drug that courses need to be used under medical supervision. For example, the most popular herbs in the people, have the ability to thicken the blood, and therefore contraindicated in patients with vascular &ndash; nettle, St. John&rsquo;s wort, yarrow, corn silk, valerian, mountaineer pochechuyny.</p>

Blood type diet by Dr. Peter D&#8217;Adamo has gained immense popularity all over the world, because it is very simple, effective and useful. Ease of it is that, when it is not necessary to calculate the compliance scores, indexes, calories and grams, as in other diet programs.</p>

<p>The efficiency of the power system is that it is very natural and offers catering exclusively products that are genetically adapted to the digestive tract of a particular person, that provides a great metabolism.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In addition, the blood type diet is healthy as eating the recommended &ldquo;proper&rdquo; food, people not only lose weight, but at the same time heals. According to Dr. D&#8217;Adamo, useful products act in the body as the most effective medicine, neutral &ndash; provide its power and energy, and harmful &ndash; poison, destroy and old.</p>

<p>The previous was described in detail the essence of the diet for blood type, classification and evolution of blood types in the world, as well as recommendations for the preparation of the menu for the first and second types.</p>

<h2>Diet for blood type 3 (type B)</h2>

<p>Diet for blood type is the third mixed and balanced, as &ldquo;nomads&rdquo; are omnivorous and equally well with a meat, dairy products and plant foods. People of this type generally have a strong immune, nervous system, strong and well adapted to changes in the diet and environment. But, despite this, unbalanced diet may be an autoimmune disease and a rare virus and are at risk for multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome and diabetes type 1.</p>

<p>Diet for weight loss in type people should avoid to the maximum foods that are high in sugar, fat, fried and smoked food, as the latter contribute to weight gain and adversely affect the liver. At the time, it is recommended to eat a diet low interest milk and milk products, vegetables (except tomatoes, pumpkins and olives), fruits, legumes, eggs and cereals (except buckwheat and wheat).</p>

<p>Of the preferred meat lamb, beef and turkey, pork should be excluded because of the high fat content, and a chicken because of its long digestion in people with the third type of blood. Should also be avoided during weight loss contribute to weight gain buckwheat, corn and peanuts, which reduce insulin production, slowing the body&rsquo;s metabolism and contribute to water retention. Give up sodas, and tomato juice, drink plenty of water, green tea and juices &ndash; cranberry, grape, pineapple, cabbage.</p>

<p>People with the third type of blood lose weight is relatively easy compared to other types, as they for weight loss, the exclusion from the diet of fatty foods, meats, fried foods and limit the use of &ldquo;binding&rdquo; fruit &ndash; persimmon, coconut, pomegranate, peanuts. Therefore, they can recommend any protein or carbohydrate diet &ndash; perfect rice, oats, kefir or any other mono-diet (except buckwheat), and the results of weight loss usually appear very quickly after the start of its implementation. In humans type suitable even &ldquo;chocolate diet&rdquo;, provided that the chocolate is black and no sugar added.</p>

<h2>Diet for blood type 4 (type AB)</h2>

<p>The fourth type is the young blood and rare (about 5% of the population), and its owners are sensitive and delicate digestive tract and the immune system is very vulnerable, are not resistant to microbes and cons of having both types &ndash; A and B. People of this type often suffer reduced hemoglobin, and also have a predisposition to heart disease and cancer.</p>

<p>Due to the combinations of types A and B in the preparation of a diet frequently occur since the same person can be reduced gastric acidity (type A) while adapting to the meat (Type B). In this case, although the programming of meat consumption, for its digestion lacks gastric juice, which ultimately leads to the deposition of fat. With this option, you need to limit the amount of meat consumed and increase the intake of vegetables and tofu, which is a great source of protein for both type A and type B for</p>

<p>The same problem often occurs when using buckwheat, corn and beans, as for type A, they are the perfect products recommended, and in type to the slow metabolism and promote weight gain. Therefore, for type AB should avoid these products, as well as products made from wheat because it contains gluten, contributing to weight gain.</p>

<p><strong>Special dietary recommendations for type AB:</strong></p>

<p>Useful low-fat meat products &ndash; turkey, lamb, rabbit, pork is prohibited, fatty lamb, goose, duck.
Recommended dairy products &ndash; yogurt, low-fat cheese and sour cream; eliminated whole milk, and butter.
Useful to use olive oil, but from sunflower and corn should be avoided.
Bread and cereals.
Of bakery products and cereals can be eaten bread from rye and wheat germ, oatmeal, rice cereal and millet; prohibited baking, buckwheat, corn flakes.
Of all the vegetables are recommended, except olives, peppers and corn, are excluded from the fruit bananas, mangoes, persimmons, oranges, coconut and grenades.
Other banned products.
On a diet give up the ketchup, vinegar, pepper, black tea, orange juice, sunflower seeds.</p>

<p>As you can see, the diet for Type AB is not very strict, so it does not require radically change dietary habits, need only to be upgraded by replacing the fat to lean meat, and other high-calorie and fatty foods to a more appropriate.</p>

<h3>Exercise as an adjunct to diet</h3>

<p>Moderate regular exercise are a great addition to the diet in the fight against excess weight. So, for the first type of people are most effective intense aerobics, skiing, swimming and running, for the second type is more suited calm and focus yoga and tai chi, and for the third and fourth &ndash; balanced sports (swimming, yoga, cycling, walking.</p>

<h3>Cautions on a diet</h3>

<p>It should be noted that the blood type diet, despite their effectiveness, can be harmful to the elderly in relation to age-related changes in the body, as well as for patients with certain health problems.</p>

<p>For example, the first and second type of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases need to limit the consumption of meat and increased consumption of raw fruits and vegetables, even one blood type, because if power is not adjusted to reflect these features can significantly harm  Same people with anemia or a lack of protein, on the contrary, increase the consumption of meat in the diet, regardless of the type of.</p>

<p>The call to increase the consumption of dairy products can be harmful in congenital lactose intolerance, and vice versa, limiting them can provoke a lack of calcium and bone problems.</p>

<p>Furthermore, any unbalanced diet is known to cause both a lack of essential nutrients, and their excess that equally good for the body. People suffering from diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease or ischemic heart disease, it is not recommended to strictly adhere to supply the same blood type. Throughout the need to comply with the measure, common sense and strict medical supervision chosen diet.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would like to point out that we should not scrupulously follow the recommendations listed above, be sure to listen to your body and heed its own individual characteristics. It is important that your food was not painful and agonizing, and strengthened health, pleasure and joy of life.</p>

Adamo, has received wide popularity around the world because it helps not only lose weight but also to normalize the body&rsquo;s metabolism, prevent the development of various diseases and provide excellent health.</p>

<h2>The essence of the blood type diet</h2>

<p>The essence of the blood type diet is that people with different blood types genetically incorporated different digestibility of the same products. Author of the procedure have noticed that, for example, recommended by many nutritionists, vegetarian diets are yielding positive results are not everything &ndash; for some people, they are not only useless, but also significantly impair the health.</p>

<p>In fact, his research has shown that some of the products that can help a person lose weight with one type of blood may even be harmful for people with another type. It is because of incorrectly matched individual menus, according to Dr. D&#8217;Adamo, a person gets fat, sick, and does damage to your health.</p>

<p>Since weight gain is usually the result of disturbances in the body metabolism, correctly made diet excludes from the diet is the foods that are toxic to a particular person, poorly digested and can not be absorbed. Thus, the blood type diet, eliminating &ldquo;harmful&rdquo; foods, helps to not only lose weight but also to cleanse the toxins that are known to be deposited in the fat depots. In addition, natural food products that corresponds to the type of blood heals entire gastro &ndash; intestinal tract and allergies disappear.</p>

<h2>The Evolution of blood types</h2>

<p>The Evolution of blood types (from first to fourth) took place gradually over the centuries as a result of adaptation of digestive and immune system to changing environmental conditions. Thus, the first type of blood is the most &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; and initially all the people on Earth were its owners. In those days, they focused solely on hunting, eating meat of dead animals (protein food), so their digestive system was ideally suited for its digestion.</p>

<p>The fourth type appeared relatively recently (about 1500 years ago) as a result of the mixing of the second and third types, and she is very rare and occurs only in 5% of the population.</p>

<p>Based on this classification, Dr. Peter D&#8217;Adamo were developed separate recommendations for weight loss and maintenance of health for all four varieties:</p>

<h2>Blood type diet of the first (type 0)</h2>

<p>Representatives of the first type (33% of the population) are natural carnivores genetically, they have increased the acidity of gastric juice, so that protein foods quickly and fully recycled and not deposited as fat. Therefore, the basis of 0 blood type diet should be lean meat (except pork and goose) &ndash; at least 5-6 times a week, fish and seafood. It is also very useful seaweed, liver, greens, lettuce, spinach, radish, radish, broccoli.</p>

<p>Due to the high acidity of the gastric juice of people with first blood often suffer from gastric ulcer, intestinal disorders and allergies, as the mucous membranes eventually begin to ulcerate. Therefore, blood type diet first should include vegetables and fruits, which have an alkaline reaction.</p>

<p>Include vegetables such properties are artichoke, cauliflower, broccoli, artichoke, onion, garlic, parsley, horseradish, parsnips, spinach and beet leaves. Of fruit is recommended to include in the diet of prunes, figs, plums, dark cherries, as well as lemon and grapefruit, which show an alkaline reaction in the stomach, despite its sour taste.</p>

<p>A from the strawberries, oranges, tangerines and strawberries should be abandoned, as these fruits excessively increase the acidity of gastric juice. The same recommendations apply to vegetable and fruit juices, beverages and condiments. Absolutely contraindicated in cabbage and apple juice, black tea, coffee, and ketchup, vinegar and mayonnaise, which are the enemies of the stomach acidity. It is recommended to drink plenty of water, green tea decoction of rose hips, peppermint and lime.</p>

<p>Dairy products should be used with caution, because the body is not adapted to their full absorption. For example, whole milk and processed cheese should be excluded altogether, as yogurt, low-fat sour cream and yogurt can be included in the menu is not more than 1-2 times a week. Eggs are a valuable source of protein can be eaten 3-4 times a week, but not more than 1 piece per day.</p>

<h2>Blood type diet second (type A)</h2>

<p>Blood type diet second includes mainly fresh and natural plant products (mainly cereals and vegetables), because the digestive system of people of type A is ideally suited for the use of vegetarian food and very poorly digested and absorbed by meat and dairy products. For example, dairy products, especially whole milk, inhibit the metabolism in the body and causes multiple allergic reactions, and therefore they should be replaced by soy or milk.</p>

<p>Because of the low acidity, characteristic of this type of people, their stomach can not digest meat, so its use contributes to the deposition of fat and a slower metabolism. So if you can not completely eliminate it from the diet, limit consumption of chicken or turkey, but rather go on unsalted fish, such as perch, carp, cod, trout, sardines or mackerel. In addition, because of delicate mucous membrane of the stomach should be excluded from the menu spicy and salty foods, sausages and smoked meat, pepper, vinegar, ketchup, mayonnaise, spices, sour fruits and berries, potatoes.</p>

<p>The source of protein in type A should be soy products, eggs and cheese. As you can eat unlimited amounts of whole cereal grains (except wheat), vegetables (except potatoes, tomatoes, olives and eggplant), fruits (except bananas, which are high in calories and too heavy for digestion) and legumes, which are useful to pre-germinate. Salads dressed with olive desirable or linseed oil, and the use of rye bread or on a wheat germ.</p>

<p>Very useful vegetable and fruit juices, such as apricots, cherries, plums, carrots, grapefruit, pineapple and celery. In addition, to prevent the causes of constipation and remove mucus from the intestines is recommended to drink plenty of water (at least two liters a day) and drink every morning on an empty stomach a glass of warm water with the juice of freshly squeezed lemon.</p>

<p>The people of type A is usually a weak immune system open to all infections, sensitive and delicate digestive tract, as well as the increased sensitivity of the nervous system. They often suffer from heart diseases and cancer, as well as tend to pathologies of the gallbladder, liver and symptoms of type 1 diabetes. For them, the recommended diet for a second type of blood is extremely important, because in vegetarian diet immune and digestive system will work more efficiently and be able to prevent the emergence of symptoms of gallstone disease and other serious illnesses.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/causes-of-greasy-hair/image.jpg" width="200" height="150" title="Causes of greasy hair, oily hair wash, homemade mask for oily hair" alt="Homemade masks for oily hair. Proper care and cleaning oily hair"> Greasy hair requires frequent washing. Oily hair often lead women to despair and cause a lot of inconvenience to them that quickly gryazneyut and by the end of the day look greasy and stale, even if they are washed in the morning. But experts urge not to get upset and argue that care for them is much easier than in the dry, which, moreover, are often brittle and weakened. In addition, oily hair, thanks to the high fat content, have a huge advantage over the dry, because they, like oily skin, thanks to the natural lubrication, well protected from adverse external influences.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Causes of oily hair</h2>

<p>The main reason is the high fat content is that the sebaceous glands work too active and produce more sebum than necessary. Increased sebum secretion is often caused by genetics, but could be evidence of violations of the endocrine system.</p>

<p>In addition, increase the separation of fat intake of antibiotics, poor nutrition, extreme temperatures, severe stress and improper care. Experts believe that the right care for oily hair will avoid many of the problems and ensure that they always look nice and neat.</p>

<h2>Wash oily hair</h2>

<p>A very important question is the frequency of washing. And if you have recently called for beauticians do not wash my hair 1-2 times a week, so as not to stimulate increased zhirootdelenie, now come to the conclusion that it is much more harmful to walk with excessively oily hair. If you do not wash your hair for a long time, the upper protective layer of the scalp are beginning to proliferate microscopic fungi and yeasts that cause itching, dandruff, acne on his head and a variety of inflammatory processes. In addition, the hair follicles become clogged with fat and sebaceous ducts harden, causing the hair to stop growing, thin and hard fall.</p>

<p>Therefore, wash oily hair should be implemented as necessary, at least every day. Water for washing should not be too hot, as hot water activates the sebaceous glands. Before washing, you need to carefully comb hair &ndash; it will partially remove dirt, dandruff and protect themselves from tangling. Shampoo need not be applied directly to the hair, because in this case it is not evenly distributed.</p>

<p>It is best to dilute a small amount of shampoo to wash with water and the resulting solution, or to put it first in the palm of your hand. Lather oily hair better twice, distributing shampoo soft circular motions and without scratching the skin nails.</p>

<p>It is important to thoroughly rinse the hair after washing, because of the remnants of shampoo they are faster and have gryazneyut adhesive and matte appearance. After washing, do not immediately need to comb your hair, they need to dry out a bit. Try to use a hair dryer only when absolutely necessary, because the temperature changes are bad for oily skin and stimulate the strengthening zhirootdeleniya.</p>

<h2>Shampoo for oily hair</h2>

<p>Shampoo for oily hair should be selected very carefully, studying the composition indicated on the label. A well-chosen shampoo helps to restore proper operation of the sebaceous glands and remove the irritation and the use of the wrong shampoo will only worsen the situation. Choose a shampoo transparent natural colors &ndash; white or off-white, creamy shampoos because the bright colors often contain poisonous unnecessary and harmful dyes.</p>

<p>The most effective are the shampoos with herbal extracts &ndash; nettle, chamomile, sage, mother and stepmother, and also contain algae, vitamins A, K, C, and zinc. In the presence of dandruff shampoos choose from zinc, sulfur and tar. Do not buy shampoos, if they contain silicone, because they are heavier hair and make them even fatter.</p>

<p>Great popularity in recent years become dry shampoos that are especially useful on business trips, travel and the absence of hot water and time. These shampoos are available in powder form and are applied by spray. After 5-10 minutes, when the powder to soak up all the grease and dirt, his combed comb.</p>

The problem of depression and other psycho-emotional disorders in this age of high speed is very urgent.</p>

<p>According to the WHO, the scale and speed of the spread of this disease are devastating, on the heels of such a &ldquo;popular&rdquo; diseases such as stroke, heart attack and diabetes. And the age of patients getting younger &ndash; if earlier depression affecting people after 40 years, but now the problem is widespread and adolescence.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>According to the same WHO, now every fourth &ndash; fifth of the Earth suffers what &ndash; or mental disorders, and by 2020 it is expected that depression will be the first in the world in disease.</p>

<p>However, do not confuse the real, medical depression with the usual blues and just a bad mood, because, at the household level depression &ndash; is sadness, grief and anguish. If you have just the blues, then there are many ways to cheer yourself and force of will to withdraw from this state.</p>

<p>Many people are faced with the phenomenon of temporary loss of mood and vitality, and everyone finds themselves out of this situation, what &ndash; something out. Who &ndash; is beginning to go hard in the gym who &ndash; that finds relief in the church, some with just dipped his head into some interesting job or hobby, alternate setting or go to rest. But if, unfortunately, you caught a real depression, then just your efforts will, unfortunately, will not be enough.</p>

<p>Depression, according to the definition in Wikipedia &ndash; is a mental disorder that is characterized by constantly depressed mood, loss of ability to experience pleasure, low self-esteem, and the complete loss of interest in life, and to that previously happy. The fact is that depression and mood decline is easily explained on a chemical level, and due to lack of production of the hormone serotonin in the body.</p>

<p>The role of this hormone in the human body is impressive &ndash; he is responsible for the process of cognitive activity, locomotor activity and muscle tone. But most importantly, it creates in us a sense of lifting mood and happiness, and so it is called the hormone of happiness. Normal levels of serotonin gives a person self-control, emotional and stress.</p>

<p>Some researchers have found that people who are dominant in society, have high levels of serotonin. People with a low level of serotonin, on the contrary, self-control, emotional stress and so reduced that the slightest pretexts are stressful, and as a result, depressed.</p>

<p>Very often people who are depressed, not knowing what was happening to them and trying to dull the emotional pain and anxiety begin to take alcohol or psychotropic substances, and this signing his own death warrant, because with the help of drugs and alcohol can only be purchased chronic alcoholism or drug addiction,  In this case, the craving for alcohol and drug abuse is secondary and serves the purpose of relieving anxiety and tension inherent in depression.</p>

<p>Moreover, the relatives of a person suffering from depression and alcohol secondary lapsed into alcoholism, of course, the best of intentions, are his &ldquo;encode&rdquo; to eliminate the pernicious craving for alcohol. But we must understand that &ldquo;coding&rdquo; refers to the psycho-terrorist methods and is based on an elementary intimidation sick that he could not lead a person to recovery, since no alcohol, no depression can not be cured in this way.</p>

<p>The big problem also lies in the fact that in our country are depressed people, especially young men, are often embarrassed to admit their psycho &ndash; emotional problems, ignore the problem and do not seek medical attention, thereby only exacerbating their condition.</p>

<p>Depression, as mentioned above, the only cure at will or not alcohol. This disease is treated with special drugs, which are called antidepressants, their effect on the regulation of the level of serotonin in the brain. There are so many antidepressants and use them to learn to successfully treat depression. Although long-term treatment and under mandatory supervision of a physician, but defeat disease is now possible once and for all.</p>

<p>Ashamed of their condition is not necessary, because it is the same disease as any other. Depression does not destroy the mind and human intelligence, it just does not allow him to live fully, and in a state of neglect often even leads to suicide.</p>

<p>Depression affects many of the greatest and brightest of today. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill struggled all his life with depression and called it &ldquo;the black dog that with me all my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therefore, if you are suffering from depression and she does not go alone for a long time, do not worry, nothing bad has happened to you, just dropped us a much-needed level of the hormone serotonin.

Fungal nail disease, symptoms and prevention"> Fungal nail disease and still require early treatment and prevention. Fungal nail disease and stop its rapid growth concern dermatologists around the world. According to their estimates, is suffering from a quarter of the world&rsquo;s population, especially in large cities with high population density, and this figure continues to grow.</p>

<h2>Causes and Symptoms of fungal infections of nails and feet</h2>

<p>Ways of getting a lot of fungus in the body, you can catch anywhere, but most often it is on the beach, in the bath, in the pool, the sauna or the shoes of people infected.</p>

<p>Nail Fungus transmitted not only from person to person, but also from animals to humans, and from the external environment. Complicating the situation is that there is a great variety of mushrooms, more than 1.5 million of them are pathogenic to humans about 500 species.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, fungal infections do not produce immunity, and a person can be infected by the same form of the fungus many times. Fungi remarkably tenacious, as evidenced by the scientists conducted an unusual experiment &ndash; they put the shoes sick fungus man in a locker, and when 20 years later got her out of there, the spores of the fungus were fully viable. Therefore a crucial role in the fight against fungi plays prevention of fungal nail diseases and personal hygiene.</p>

<p>Mushrooms particularly active subject in humidity, heat and poor ventilation, and excessive use of soaps and detergents do not give that effect, which we expect hard observing hygiene. The fact that the surface of our skin has a protective, so-called lipid layer, the finest film of fat that they live in our &ldquo;native&rdquo; beneficial bacteria designed to protect us from the adverse effects of the environment.</p>

<p>Doctors do not recommend to wash with soap and water often, as when washing wool we literally rip off off this protective film, and a variety of micro-organisms, bacteria and fungi literally stick to our body without resistance, is not completely restore the natural cover, which takes about</p>

<p>An interesting scientific fact &ndash; in the 30-ies of the last century, during the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Chukchi, Evenki and other northern nations have become hard to teach hygiene, wash with soap making. The result was so unexpected that at first the doctors just shrugged and could not understand why Aboriginal started such a colossal death.</p>

<p>As it turned out later, soap destroying the protective layer of fat covering their skin and they were completely defenseless against the invasion of microorganisms. By the way, the researchers argue that it is for this same reason, and we often get sick after a bath, and not from the fact that hypothermia is commonly thought. Nature, as we know, did not know soap, the use of detergents &ndash; is a recent invention of European civilization. If you do not want to kill a cat or dog, do not wash them with soap or shampoo, because the animal can not live long in such a &ldquo;sterile&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If it affects the human fungal disease, first, as a rule, there are cracks between the toes and on the soles, and then passes the infection on your nails. It is believed that the fungus uncured stop sooner or later turns into a nail fungus from which escape is not so easy. Man begins to disturb the symptoms of fungal nail diseases &ndash; itching, discomfort and bad breath. Nail changes color becomes dull, opaque, crumbles, deformed, thickened. If the disease is not treated in time, the nail may collapse completely, and the fungus will eventually hit the nails on the hands.</p>

<p>If you do not fight the infection, the fungus begins to &ldquo;walk&rdquo; around the body, releasing toxins that affects the lymphatic and circulatory systems, reduces immunity and causes multiple allergies, sometimes even able to hit the brain. Man gets tired quickly, feel malaise, nausea, frequent colds.</p>

<h2>Prevention of fungal nail diseases</h2>

<p>Nail fungal disease is considered to be the surrender of immunity, so it is often susceptible to it people with weakened or immature immune, that is, children and the elderly. Considered a risk factor for various scratches, abrasions and other skin damage through which the fungus is easier to penetrate into the body, which are the gateway for incoming infections.</p>

<p>If you notice the first signs of fungal nail disease, such as discoloration of the nail, its transparency, thickening of the nail plate, an inflammation of the skin around the nail, as well as itching and redness between the toes, it is necessary without delay to see a doctor &ndash; dermatologist and deliver  The fungus is now successfully treated thanks to the arsenal of physicians in a large range of antifungal drugs. Most importantly, time to start treatment and prevent total capture of infection in your body.</p>

<p>If the affected area is small, it is often possible to cope with the fungus by local treatment. If the process of infection went away, then the treatment will be more time consuming, but, in any case, it should bring to an end, as the untreated fungus necessarily continue its destructive work. In the treatment of a family member, all others should also be examined, as most at risk of infection.</p>

<p>Better prevention of fungal infections of nails and feet &ndash; a thorough safety precautions to prevent re-infection. If you have been in a public bath and not too sure of its sterility, the best means of prevention is the treatment of foot boric alcohol or vinegar diluted as 1 tablespoon per cup of water, the media is detrimental to the fungus. Do not wear someone else&rsquo;s shoes, dry the feet, all the scratches and damage immediately treated with iodine or green paint.</p>

Secrets of longevity"> Secrets of centenarians &ndash; in their diet. The greatest Greek physician Hippocrates and teacher, whose name is in our perception is inextricably linked with the famous Hippocratic Oath, rightly considered the &ldquo;father of medicine&rdquo;, claimed that any human disease is due to a breach of food habits and lifestyle.</p>

<p>It belongs to Hippocrates famous phrase: &ldquo;We are what we eat&rdquo;, thus emphasizing the most important role nutrition for human life and health.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Without exception, all people want to live a long time, but have to stay healthy, vigorous, firm in the mind and memory. Scientists around the world are trying to find the answer to the secrets of longevity, carefully study this phenomenon, trying to understand why so few people manage to live so long without the disease, although genetically the human capacity for approximately 150 years of life.</p>

<h2>Power centenarians</h2>

<p>Despite the huge number of hypotheses about the secrets of health and longevity, as well as the fact that all the various centenarians living conditions &ndash; climatic, geographical, social, and views of all scientists in agreement that the power of centenarians is very closely linked with longevity and plays it  For all their differences and peculiarities, long-lived of all regions of the Earth have very similar features and rules for the use of food.</p>

<p>Slightly paraphrasing the famous line of Hippocrates, you can add that person &ndash; it&rsquo;s not only what he eats, but also the fact that he was drinking. All the world&rsquo;s centenarians drink only pure, natural spring water, which is the most important secret of longevity, since the human body is 75% water and therefore it is very important what kind of water it makes its internal reserves. On the crucial role of water in human life, norms of consumption and correct drinking regime for health read the article on our website.</p>

<p>Secrets of centenarians is pretty simple, like all brilliant. Centenarians world eat only those foods that grow in their climate zone without using anything to eat imported and exotic. It is so right that we should consider whether we need, such as bananas, which, undoubtedly, are a storehouse of vitamins, but only if they break and then eat.</p>

<p>However, as is known, bananas have not grow, they rip green, immature and thus are coated with wax and other harmful chemical compounds for prolonged preservation and transportation. So I ask, we need such fruits is not it better to eat an apple? The same question arises about the imported strawberries and watermelons have no taste, no smell, no good. Is not it better to wait for the season to gorge and plenty of delicious and healthy fruits and vegetables that grow in our area?</p>

<p>All centenarians eat very little of the world, never overeat and get up from the table without a sense of satiety. They are no excess weight and obesity, which are known to not add health and longevity. About the dangers of overeating and benefits of short breaks from eating to read this article.</p>

<p>Food in the diet dominated by long-lived low-fat and low-fat, which is very useful for keeping in perfect condition of blood vessels and the prevention of hypertension. The use of low-calorie food that has high biological activity, has long been experimentally proved by many scientists. Well known scientific experiment conducted on rats &ndash; in a subgroup of animals that reduced caloric intake by a quarter, life expectancy increased by 32%. However, where calorie reduced by 50%, the rats lived twice as long.</p>

<p>Food centenarians consume only fresh, it keeps the most of the vitamins and nutrients of food. Naturally, they reject the canned food and other unhealthy foods. No fast food, reheating and yesterday&rsquo;s food out of the fridge, all the half-eaten give cattle.</p>

<p>By the way, according to some studies, this indispensable in the modern kitchen thing as a microwave, just destroys the products have passed the microwave treatment, vitamins, minerals and nutrients. Therefore, whenever possible, should follow the example of centenarians &ndash; cook gruel and then eat it, not a three-day warm up in the microwave soup, which does not have anything useful. Especially do not recommend to warm up food in the microwave for small children.</p>

<p>Power centenarians virtually includes entrees and rich broth and meat on their menu is mainly present in cooked form. On the table there is always a lot of different herbs that help to keep the gut flora in perfect condition. In centenarians Abkhazia and Azerbaijan on the composition of intestinal microflora in general identical to the flora of healthy children, which is achieved by regular consumption of the national dairy products, which are known to be very useful for proper digestion.</p>

<p>An important secret of longevity is also made in the absence of sugar in their diet in its purest form, as well as a variety of jams, chocolates and other sweets today that can trigger the development of diabetes. Sugar they receive in the form of glucose, which is necessary for the body to quickly replenish energy deficit by eating honey, raisins and a variety of sweet fruit. Fruits and vegetables make up a large portion of all food centenarians.</p>

<p>Chinese gerontologists are absolutely sure that the formula found longevity and looks like this &ndash; very low calorie diet, with a minimal amount of fat and animal protein and lots of vegetables and fruits.</p>

<p>As far as this is true, time will tell, but do for yourself useful conclusions and adopt some simple secrets of centenarians in the diet, we just have to. Having started eating right, as do the long-lived all over the world, we will stop gaining weight, get sick, we are in great shape and, therefore, will live longer.</p>

    <updated>2013-11-28T23:10:00+06:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/periodontal-disease/image.jpg" width="200" height="150" title="Periodontal disease, bleeding gums, periodontal" alt="Periodontal disease and bleeding gums"> Successful treatment of periodontal disease depends on timely access to a doctor. Bleeding gums is the most common symptom of periodontal disease &ndash; a complex of tissues surrounding and holding the teeth in the jaw bone. Despite the fact that by Parodont also include bone around the teeth and muscle ligaments that hold the teeth in the jaw bones, most people are faced with the problem of gum &ndash; regular or occasional bleeding, swelling and inflammation.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Many people mistakenly believe trifling periodontal disease and do not require emergency treatment of symptomatic &ndash; with &ldquo;harmless&rdquo; bleeding gums simply rinse their mouth herbs and do not go to the doctor. However, engaging in self-treatment, they cause serious damage to your health.</p>

<p>Fact that gingivitis (initial stage of periodontitis), the main symptom is bleeding gums, quite successfully (nearly 100%) is treatable if it initiated when the first symptoms.</p>

<p>If the disease takes the form of running, then there is a risk of losing teeth even at a young age. According to the WHO, 80% of children under the age of 10 years, there are already early signs of gingivitis, which is associated with significant physiological stress of the periodontal tissues in a growing body when cutting, shaping and growth of teeth.</p>

<p>For older people, because they have periodontitis tooth loss occurs in 95% of cases. However, there is good news &ndash; if only a few decades ago with the disease periodontitis keep the teeth was considered virtually impossible, the modern development of zubosohranyayuschih technology to successfully stop the destructive process.</p>

<h2>What is periodontal disease and periodontal disease &ndash; what&rsquo;s the difference between them</h2>

<p>Periodontal disease is a relatively rare disease (it accounts for only about 3 &ndash; 4% of the cases of periodontal problems), while periodontitis is &ldquo;honorable&rdquo; second among all dental disease (caries immediately after), and is present to varying degrees in nearly 95.</p>

<h2>Periodontal disease causes and symptoms</h2>

<p>Periodontal disease &ndash; is a non-inflammatory disease of periodontal tissues, which are due to internal disturbances in the body, leading to malnutrition and periodontal tissue perfusion and, as a consequence, to atrophy of the alveolar bone (bone edges of the hole tooth).</p>

<p>As a result of atrophic processes in periodontitis occur sclerotic changes in the bone tissue, reduced interdental septum, and the gums gradually become thinner and the like &ldquo;settle down&rdquo;, resulting in the effect of &ldquo;wedge-shaped teeth&rdquo; with bare roots. In the future, increased sensitivity to chemical and thermal stimuli, changing the color and the enamel is destroyed. Subsequently, as a result of running and complete atrophy, the teeth become loose and fall out much.</p>

<p>Local factors, in particular the impact of micro-organisms essential role in the development of the disease do not play, but serve only unfavorable factor aggravating.</p>

<h2>Periodontal disease symptoms and the stage</h2>

<p>Periodontitis, in contrast to periodontal disease, is an inflammatory nature and manifests the destruction of the connection between the tooth, gum and surrounding tissues, the formation of deep periodontal pockets and the gradual deformation and destruction of the bone hole tooth.</p>

<p>Because periodontal disease most often develops slowly and gradually over the years does not cause discomfort in the early stages it is quite difficult to diagnose. However, it should be noted that there are cases sufficient and rapid development of the disease.</p>

<h2>Step periodontitis</h2>

<p>First, the easy, harmless and effectively treatable stage of periodontal disease (gingivitis) is accompanied by a slight redness, inflammation and bleeding gums, bad breath and the formation of shallow periodontal pockets.</p>

<p>While moderate adds the following symptoms &ndash; a small tooth mobility, the emergence of cracks and gaps between the teeth, on education-and subgingival stones, difficulty in chewing food, deepening periodontal pockets (up to 5 mm) with a small selection of them.</p>

<p>In severe teeth start to hurt badly, offset, in part, loose and fall out, and deepened periodontal pockets and from their cavities are frequent and copious purulent discharge with an unpleasant odor.</p>

<p>Causes periodontal disease are diverse and the main of them are traditionally considered to be a lack of oral hygiene, however, all is not as easy as it might seem. Indeed, the microbes that live in the mouth and form plaque (stones), can affect the periodontal tissues, they cause inflammation and lead to loosening and loss of teeth. Therefore, periodic professional scaling is necessary, but, unfortunately, the lack of means of prevention.</p>

<p>Equally important role in the development of pathology plays the uneven load on the teeth, malocclusion uncorrected, errors prosthetics and jaw injuries. For example, periodontal disease often develops if removed 6th teeth and dentures soon not installed or improperly formed contact between the upper and lower jaws. Adverse effect might wear braces, microtrauma while cutting the thread, the habit of chewing on one side, leading to an overload of a separate part of the jaw, use as toothpicks metal objects, the effect on enamel acid and alkali.</p>

<p>It is important that the seals were installed correctly &ndash; do not protrude over the edge of the tooth, and at the same time, a close fit to it. If the seal is not tight fits, the germs and infections can easily penetrate to the root and destroy it, but if the seal hangs, it prevents the removal of plaque quality, and as a consequence, inflammation of the gum tissue. In case of improper prosthetic disease process develops locally, ie, only in problem areas. In such cases we say about the local gingivitis or periodontitis local.</p>

<p>In addition, the trigger for the development of the disease often appear overall negative factors for the entire body &ndash; lowered immunity, salivary gland diseases, endocrine diseases and malnutrition. In this case, the pathological process is developing in the area of ​​the teeth and is of a generalized (universal) the nature &ndash; of a generalized gingivitis or periodontitis.</p>

<h2>Periodontitis treatment</h2>

<p>Treatment of periodontal disease in the early stages, as mentioned, has a very good prognosis, so it is very important at the first warning signs, consult a dentist. First of all, you should alert the occurrence of bleeding when brushing your teeth and chewing hard food.</p>

<p>First, try replacing your toothbrush at a softer and more use toothpaste and mouthwash with the addition of healing, restorative and antiseptic natural components. If this does not lead to the desired result, you should immediately seek medical attention &ndash; periodontist, as the bleeding can not be ignored.</p>

<p>In the first phase treatment is limited, as a rule, professional cleaning and removal of plaque and use of folk remedies for periodontal disease &ndash; applications of aloe leaves and rinse with infusions and decoctions of medicinal herbs (chamomile, oak bark, sage, plantain). Traditional medicine with bleeding gums are also advised to rub them with sea salt, honey &ndash; Mix 20 g of honey with 5 &ndash; 10 g salt and rub the teeth and gums every day, not leading to injury.</p>

<p>In addition, the presence of periodontal pockets doctor offers them washing with antiseptic solutions &ndash; a process that helps reduce inflammation and swelling of the gums and reduce bleeding. If the teeth lose their stability, showed a temporary or permanent splinting especially strong ribbons &ndash; first on the tooth surfaces make the groove depth of about 0.5 mm, and then placed her in the tape and cover the filling material.</p>

<p>To gain stability, and widely used surgical techniques, in particular patchwork technique, transplantation of bone and soft tissues and artificial guided bone regeneration. Flap operation applies to the case where the gingival pocket too deep (greater than 5 mm) to reduce its depth. To do this, a small incision is made in the gum area and cleared of stones baring at the root. Then align the affected contour of bone and sutured incision.</p>

<p>Transplantation of soft tissue (taken from the sky) is applied at the tooth roots and bared for cosmetic purposes, and bone transplants (of their own bone or synthetic) used in significant destruction of the bone tissue for retaining the tooth, and for regeneration of new bone tissue.</p>

<h3>Treatment of periodontal disease</h3>

<p>Despite the fact that an effective treatment of periodontal disease is currently no exist as physiotherapy and surgical modern technology to recover gums and relieve itching, pain, hypersensitivity and other unpleasant symptoms.</p>

<p>Physical therapy aimed at improving blood circulation and regeneration processes in the periodontium. These include massage gums darsonvalization, vakuumoterapiya, flyuktuorizatsiya, gingival shower, UHF and magnetic-laser therapy. A good massage for the gums and the best prevention of periodontal disease is the chewing of solid plant foods. Abuse of soft refining food leads to exhaustion and bone atrophy, and with regular chewing solid foods, especially raw vegetables and fruit, on the contrary, there is a training vessel gums and natural cleansing of plaque.</p>

<p>Of the surgical treatment of periodontal disease using surgery to remove the periodontal pockets, removal of microabscesses and festering gums, bone grafting, removal of infected overgrown soft tissue closure of exposed roots, raised descended gums. One promising area of ​​treatment of periodontal disease is the use of cellular technologies to stimulate the recovery of their own bone. Similar operations are underway in Moscow.</p>

<h2>Prevention of periodontal disease</h2>

<p>For the prevention of periodontal disease should be serious about the state of their teeth:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 at least once a year to visit the dentist for a professional oral hygiene;</li>
<li>Brushing teeth 2 times a day, and possibly after every meal;</li>
<li>Remove it after eating the remains of the interdental spaces with dental floss;</li>
<li>To choose a toothbrush with rounded and not too coarse bristles;</li>
<li>Eat right. For periodontal health in the menu should be physiologically required amount of protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and trace elements. Do not abuse the sweets and eat more fresh organic fruits and vegetables.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/causes-of-hemorrhoids/image.jpg" width="200" height="150" title="Causes of hemorrhoids" alt="Hemorrhoids - Causes, Symptoms, stages and modern methods of treatment"> Modern methods of hemorrhoid treatment eliminates the need for surgery. Hemorrhoids called the veins of the rectum, resulting in the formation hemorrhoids that cause severe pain (especially in the act of defecation), bleed, fall out and cause a lot of people suffering physical and social problems.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Unfortunately, hemorrhoids have traditionally been considered &lsquo;shameful&rsquo; intimate problem and therefore postponed the visit to the doctor, as a rule, to the last, when the disease has already started and is accompanied by a strong unbearable bolyu.Po to the proctologist, about 70% of people experience these or other symptoms</p>

<h2>Causes of hemorrhoids</h2>

<p>Causes of hemorrhoids are quite diverse &ndash; an impetus to the development of the disease can provide both genetic factors (congenital anomalies of venous walls) and the error in the diet, unhealthy lifestyle, chronic internal diseases and pregnancy.</p>

<p><strong>Among the main causes of the disease doctors are the following:</strong></p>

<p>Long-term sedentary work leads to stagnation of blood in the pelvic organs. Therefore, the risk of disease has traditionally include all workers of &ldquo;sedentary&rdquo; jobs &ndash; drivers, accountants, operators, programmers, and the like</p>

<p>A sedentary lifestyle also contributes to the development of hemorrhoids, as due to lack of physical activity, and there is blood stasis is formed venous insufficiency.</p>

<p>Finding feet long and considerable physical load is not less harmful than hypodynamy as delay provokes blood in the veins and increase the pressure therein, resulting in venous wall gradually loses its elasticity. This process is most susceptible to teachers, dancers, hair stylists, as well as loaders and lifters.</p>

<p>Chronic constipation, according to the doctors, are the most common cause of hemorrhoids. As a result of constipation bowel movement feces inside difficult, it accumulates in the lower parts of it and pinched the vein, thus significantly impairing blood flow. In addition, further increase intra-abdominal pressure attempts suffering severe constipation in the act of defecation.</p>

<p>Alcohol and spicy food. Hot spices contribute to a strong flow of blood to the rectum and irritate the delicate lining of her. Alcohol provokes an excessive expansion of blood vessels and blood stagnation in the formation and inflammation of hemorrhoids.</p>

<p>Different tumors and inflammation in the pelvis often causes the development of hemorrhoids. These include gynecological problems (fibroids, uterine fibroids), inflammation of the prostate, liver cirrhosis, cancer of the rectum, as well as fistulas, ulcers and fissures.</p>

<p>Pregnancy and childbirth. During pregnancy, the growing uterus displaces all the organs of the pelvis up and the rectum, on the contrary, pressed down to the pelvic bone, squeezing blood vessels and helping to expand the veins and the formation of hemorrhoids. In the process of childbirth situation is further aggravated by the strong attempts mothers.</p>

<h2>Internal and external hemorrhoids</h2>

<p>Hemorrhoids is divided into inner and outer, depending on where the hemorrhoids are located outside or inside.</p>

<p>When an internal hemorrhoid nodes are located in the lumen of the rectum. Outside the acute stage they are not visible to the eye and are determined only by special equipment. In the initial stage of internal hemorrhoids person usually has no idea of ​​developing the disease, while internal hemorrhoids do not begin to emerge in the act of defecating outside.</p>

<p>For external hemorrhoids nodes are outside around the anus, where they can be easily detected during normal feeling, even in the primary, painless stage. In practice, quite often (about 50% of cases) occurs combined hemorrhoids, which combines features of external and internal types.</p>

<h2>Symptoms and stages of hemorrhoids</h2>

<p>The first symptoms of hemorrhoids are usually quite low, so they do not pay too much attention. However, as the disease progresses, all the unpleasant and painful sensations are enhanced.</p>

<p>First, the disease manifests itself only a feeling of heaviness or a sensation of a foreign body in the anus &ndash; this is due to swelling of the internal tissues of the anal canal.</p>

<p>After that arise in the anus itching and burning &ndash; a consequence of increasing the hemorrhoids, which is accompanied by minor blood and mucus secretions and causes irritation of the skin around the anus.</p>

<p>Then there are regular bleeding during discharge (of varying intensity). If at this stage to start emergency treatment hemorrhoids begin to precipitate and severe pain is constant, not only during defecation, but also in a sitting position and walking.</p>

<p>Proctologists distinguish 4 stages of hemorrhoids, depending on how much enlarged nodes, and how developed the degenerative process in the tissues muscle.</p>

<p>The first stage &ndash; increasing hemorrhoids, there is itching, burning, foreign body sensation in the anus, there are slight discharge of blood at the time of discharge. Because these symptoms are not permanent and occur only occasionally, the vast number of patients at this stage of hemorrhoids do not go to the doctor, the disease moves to the next stage.</p>

<p>The second stage &ndash; during bowel movements begin to &ldquo;creep&rdquo; nodules on toilet paper appearing regularly drop of blood. At this stage the nodes themselves are hiding back after bowel movements or a short period of time.</p>

<p>The third step &ndash; dropping nodes patient has to reduce a hand into the rectum to achieve more &ndash; less comfortable state. At this stage, the disease is already advanced, progressive and requires immediate medical attention, as the nodules begin to fall, not only during defecation, but also with any increase in intra-abdominal pressure (coughing, sneezing, lifting weights and even with little physical load).</p>

<p>The fourth stage &ndash; hemorrhoids will not reduce a fall or immediately after the reduction, look like bunch of grapes, very inflamed and painful. At this stage, very frequent bleeding, and pain in the anus is so strong that it is impossible to even touch the toilet paper. Intense frequent bleeding lead to anemia (low hemoglobin in the blood), which further worsens the patient&rsquo;s well-being.</p>

<p>In addition, the constant loss of hemorrhoids anal sphincter tone is reduced, and this may be total or partial incontinence of gas and liquid stool, which is a huge additional psychological problem for patients.</p>

<h2>Hemorrhoid Treatment at present</h2>

<p>Hemorrhoid Treatment in modern conditions completely depends on the stage of the disease &ndash; the sooner you start treatment, the better and faster will be the end result.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the fourth stage of the disease, and, in some cases, with the third, no surgery do not work, so see your doctor as soon as possible and do not diagnose yourself by yourself. Self-treatment of hemorrhoids is dangerous because its symptoms such as itching, pain, bleeding and mucus, characteristic of many other diseases, including cancer.</p>

<p>According to medical statistics, in Europe, colorectal cancer ranks second among all diseases after lung cancer. This is due primarily to the fact that patients often go to the doctor too late, allowing you to develop many of the pathological processes and letting them start. There are cases where people have their own long-term cure hemorrhoids local Foot and micro enema, and as a result are hospitalized with terminal cancer of the colon.</p>

<p>If a proctologist after a comprehensive survey put you diagnose hemorrhoids, take responsibility for his recommendations, because the time to initiation of treatment will help in most cases, to avoid surgery and cure hemorrhoids without pain and complications. Under current conditions, only 5 -10% of cases of hemorrhoids require surgical intervention, in other successfully conducted minimally invasive non-surgical treatment methods.</p>

<p>In the first stage of hemorrhoids can be successfully treated with folk remedies, flebotropnyh drugs, various ointments, suppositories and preventive measures (special diet, therapeutic exercise, and the normalization of the bowel). If the disease is accompanied by hemorrhoidal bleeding, to eliminate it on the first and second stages of the disease is effective method of sclerotherapy.</p>

<p>After a few treatments of sclerotherapy improved tone of the anal canal, swelling and inflammation subside, the pain disappears. The procedure is as follows &ndash; a hemorrhoid or under the mucous membrane next to him is a special sklerotiruyuschim injection drug. Under the influence of drugs node is compacted, reduced in size and eventually atrophies (waived).</p>

<p>On the second and third stages of the patient may be asked to latekstnoe ligation sites &ndash; the newest popular method of treating hemorrhoids proctology in the world, which is a low-invasive, painless and performed on an outpatient basis. The essence of it is this &ndash; with the help of special devices on the hemorrhoid puts special latekstnoe ring that pinches the leg assembly and blocks blood flow in it. About a week and there is no manipulation of the node is expelled with the faeces.</p>

<p>Even if you have stage four of hemorrhoids, do not despair, modern proctology is not standing still and painful surgery hemorrhoidectomy with long-term disability benefits for a long time in the past. Instead, surgeons have successfully used the latest technology called &ldquo;dezarterizatsiya hemorrhoids through suture ligation.&rdquo; Dezarterizatsiya made, usually under local anesthesia in a day hospital, lasts no more than 30 &ndash; 40 minutes and a few hours after surgery, the patient may be allowed to go home.</p>

The human papilloma virus (HPV), or human papillomavirus, is a very common infectious viral disease that is transmitted from person to person, or sexual contact &ndash; through everyday.</p>

<p>According to medical statistics, it infected more than 50% of the population, especially vulnerable to his people with a weak immune system.</p>

<h2>What is the human papilloma virus</h2>

<p>The human papilloma virus &ndash; is the common name of a large group of viruses that includes more than 100 varieties.  ).</p>

<p>Doctors say that 75% of the adult population are healthy carriers of HPV, as many of his views of children are infected even in children&rsquo;s groups. However, before clinical manifestations, that is, warts, papillomas and warts, comes not always. In addition, the vast majority of infected children and young people (mostly under 25) appeared papillomas and warts go away on their own.</p>

<p>Fact that papilloma &ndash; virus, which does not penetrate deeply into the body and blood, it resides exclusively in the basal layer of the upper skin. Therefore, if an infected person&rsquo;s immune system is strong and powerful, he will banish HPV and HPV go away without treatment. If you have contracted the virus in adulthood and his expulsion did not happen for 1 &ndash; 3 years, you become a chronic carrier of it. In this case, with the papilloma &ndash; virus, most likely, you will have to put up with all my life, since drugs, completely killing it, scientists have not yet invented.</p>

<p>The incubation period of HPV infection usually lasts for several months, but in some cases may be increased up to several years. There are cases when HPV lives in the body for many years, sometimes from birth, not giving themselves known and seen for the first time in old age, under the influence of any adverse factors that triggered the depression of immunity.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is safe to say that, as in case of other viral and fungal infections (herpes, thrush), the appearance of papillomas and warts indicates a decline in immunity and only begins when the body&rsquo;s defenses weakened to such an extent that they are unable to  According to recent reports, even the formation of calluses on his feet through a type of papillomavirus.</p>

<p>Activation of HPV, in which the disease becomes invisible to the clinical stage, contribute to frequent change of sexual partners, urogenital infections (gerpevirus, chlamydia, ureomikoplazmoz, mycoplasmosis), immunodeficiency, hypothermia, severe stress, depression, alcohol abuse and smoking.</p>

<h2>Is it dangerous to papillomavirus</h2>

<p>When asked how dangerous papillomas and warts, doctors answer is that it depends only on the degree of tumorigenicity of the virus. There are viruses nizkoonkogennye (6, 11, 42, 43, 44), medium oncogenicity (31, 33, 35, 51, 52, 58) and a high degree of tumorigenicity (16, 18, 45, 56). Sometimes the same person can have multiple types of viruses at the same time.</p>

<p>Current laboratory methods for diagnosis of HPV, the most informative and sensitive of which is a PCR (polymerase chain reaction), allow to precisely determine the type of virus and its danger, that is, whether it is to oncogenic types.</p>

<p>Different types of virus in the human body often behave differently. It is known that the human papilloma virus type 2 is a non-tumorigenic, affects mainly the skin (skin papilloma virus) and causes warts and moles hanging on different parts of the body. The most frequent HPV in the neck, armpits, eyelids, under the breasts in women, but they can settle down and to the mucous membranes of the nose, throat, mouth, vocal cords, bladder, intestines and stomach.</p>

<p>Viruses 6 and 11 types are characterized by a low risk of carcinogenicity and provoke the development of papillomas of the mucous membranes of the genitals called genital genital warts or genital warts. Women warts often located on the labia, the cervix, the vagina, perineal urethra and anus. In men, they tend to focus on the head and body of the penis, sometimes in the urethra, which provokes a difficulty urinating, spraying urine and change in shape of the jet.</p>

<p>The most unfavorable for carcinogenicity are HPV types 16 and 18, often found in women with cervical cancer and in men with cancer lesions of the penis. Women who have found these types of HPV, for the prevention of cancer process, it is recommended mandatory vaccination.</p>

<h2>Diagnosis and treatment of warts and warts</h2>

<p>Treatment of HPV performed only in cases where there are any clinical manifestations &ndash; HPV or genital warts as well as their appearance indicates the activation of HPV. Completely remove the virus from the body, unfortunately, can not, can only be possible to suppress the activity of the viral infection and translate it into a &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; state, preventing relapse and reoccurrence of tumors.</p>

<p>Treatment of HPV infection consists of two stages &ndash; first performed the complete removal of papillomas (warts), and then held restorative therapy, aimed at strengthening the immune system and preventing relapse (receipt of antiviral drugs, vitamins, immunostimulants).</p>

<p>Now remove warts is carried out in many clinics modern and effective ways &ndash; by using a laser beam of liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy), by electrocoagulation (affecting papilloma electric current of high frequency) and radio waves. The most common methods of laser removal and removal of warts with nitrogen.</p>

<p>Laser removal of warts on the neck, eyelids, under the breasts, face and any other part of the body is made in a few minutes. The advantages of laser destruction include the fact that during the removal of warts laser they disappear forever, as the virus is killed by the heat of the laser beam. After the procedure in place papilloma dry crust is formed, under which there is healing. After 10 &ndash; 14 days it automatically disappears, while the skin is not different in color from the surrounding tissue.</p>

<p>Remove warts with liquid nitrogen is carried out, on the contrary, due to very low temperatures (&ndash; 196 C), with removable fabric from freezing completely destroyed and subsequently falls off, the skin underneath it loses its sensitivity and becomes white. Advantages of this method &ndash; after cryoablation procedure is left scars, does not require anesthesia, the wound heals quickly.</p>

<p>Remove Warts on the genitals or in the perineum, especially when a large area of ​​destruction, large-scale tumors or lesions of the anal canal, often requires general anesthesia. The main condition &ndash; all warts should be removed in a single session, to prevent the possibility of re-infection. After removal of warts patient assigned intramuscular injection analgesics for 5 &ndash; 6 days, and antiviral creams and ointments.</p>

<h2>Prevention of HPV infection</h2>

<p>In recent years, many people, especially young people, a very lightly to infections, sexually transmitted, trusting, if necessary, by means of powerful antibiotics. However, it is a dangerous delusion, because the viruses, including human papillomavirus, is not amenable to antibiotics. In addition, they are very unpredictable and difficult to establish.</p>

<p>By the cunning of HPV include the fact that the use of condoms during sex is not sufficiently reliable means of protection against papilloma infection, as well as from genital herpes because the ground is enough to infect the skin and mucous membranes. Therefore, prevention of HPV is becoming of major importance, especially for women.</p>

<p>If men, for the most part, after the infection are asymptomatic carriers of most types of HPV, the infection for women can have much more serious consequences &ndash; in 95% of women with cervical cancer and HPV diagnosed. That is why every woman should at least 1 time per year to visit the gynecologist and take a swab from the cervix to detect changes in the state of epithelial cells in the early stages.</p>

<p>This test, called «pap-smear» (PAP test), according to doctors, will significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality of women from cervical cancer in developed countries. In addition, infected women should do regular cervical colposcopy (examination of the state of the mucous membranes and tissues under a microscope), and if necessary, cytology suspicious areas.</p>

<p>According to the scientists, all of which appeared Hanging moles, warts and other growths should be removed prophylactically, without waiting for their rebirth in the disease. For example, if time does not make the removal of genital warts, they are self-propagating away from the area of ​​primary education, and to create all the new centers. In severe cases, the warts may coalesce with each other, getting kind of cauliflower, break away during intercourse, bleeding and even interfere with walking.</p>

<p>Since papilloma virus infection tends to recur after removal of tumors is necessary to carry out the mandatory control of cure and implement a set of measures that increase the activity of immune system and overall resistance to viruses and infections. To do this, you need to give up bad habits (smoking, alcohol), do not use without urgent need antibiotics, eat healthy, exercise regularly, walking in the fresh air and possibly to protect themselves from the stress.</p>

Moles or nevi are medically, have each person and are small, light brown spots are usually no more than the size of a pea.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The cause of birthmarks</h2>

<p>Most often, they are located on the body, at least on the mucous membranes of the eye or retina. A child is born without a birthmark, nevus first begin to appear at the age of 1-2 years, with the first tan, and usually unobtrusive and small in number. The most active moles appear at puberty and during pregnancy, aided hormonal changes the body.</p>

<p>The cause of birthmarks is not fully understood, but the emergence of new nevi always mean that at this point in the top layer of skin has accumulated melanin &ndash; the pigment that gives the skin a dark color.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for the appearance of moles, especially the large number of them, scientists believe a long exposure to the sun, most often nevi appear on exposed skin &ndash; face, shoulders and arms. They are more prone to the appearance of people with blue eyes and red hair, white skin and freckles, and the important role of genetic factors.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that nevi are benign tumors, they must be treated very carefully, in any case, do not hurt and do not burn home remedies in case of accidental damage. The fact that nevi, unfortunately, can sometimes degenerate into malignant melanoma &ndash; the most common form of skin cancer. Therefore, any change in a mole, whether it is color, size, tenderness or bleeding, should alert you and ask advice from a dermatologist.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the owners of a large number of nevi are more at risk of getting melanoma of the skin, for which there is good news &ndash; the researchers found that such people have a much slower the biological aging of cells. A slower aging, as well known, is a sign of longevity and reduces the severity of various age-related diseases such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and many other.</p>

<h2>Is it possible to remove moles</h2>

<p>On the question of whether to remove moles, physicians respond positively, if necessary, for example in traumatic injuries or qualitative changes nevus.  Especially susceptible to this birthmark, located on the palms, soles, scalp and neck, as well as those who are touched constantly clothes and accessories, injured when shaving and brushing. Any injury &ndash; is an occasion to visit a specialist to check the nature of the emerging changes.</p>

<p>Special attention pay attention to the size, color and shape of moles. If they do not grow or shrink in size, so are inactive and are not dangerous. If some of them are starting to grow strongly, rises above the level of the skin becomes uneven color (random mix of black, brown, gray and pink), has wrong jagged edges, cracks or asymmetric, then you need to seek immediate medical attention if necessary.</p>

<p>The main causes of malignant transformation of nevi doctors call trauma and exposure to the sun. With the very people with fair skin and a large number of moles (more than 50), especially if they include large (6 mm in diameter), it is necessary to limit the residence time in the open sun. They are not in any way be &ldquo;burn&rdquo; in the sun, because the sun burns occur during the development of malignant melanoma.</p>

<p>Is strictly forbidden to seal the birthmark before going in the sun, because the greenhouse effect may also contribute to its rebirth. Best of all these people in the shadows, as even sun creams are not able to fully protect nevi from harmful UV rays. To prevent dehydration of the skin and body, you need to drink every day for at least two liters of plain water.</p>

<p>Do not remove moles in beauty salons and at home grandmother&rsquo;s recipes. Modern medicine has at its disposal a reliable and safe methods of removal of nevi &ndash; a laser, microwave, and elektroizlucheniya using liquid nitrogen. Only careful and respect for one&rsquo;s skin can protect you from any serious problems.</p>

Opposition to the development of micro-and macrovascular.</p>

<p>In diabetes, insulin deficiency addition, broken oxidative processes in the muscle due to which they can not utilize glucose. At the same physical stress oxidative enzyme activity is significantly enhanced in the blood are increased alkaline reserves, thereby increasing the uptake and consumption of glucose by muscles, decreases hyperglycemia and increased tolerance of the organism in carbohydrates. In addition, exercise in combination with insulin increase the therapeutic effect of insulin, strengthen the nervous and cardiovascular system of the patient, increase the body&rsquo;s resistance and prevent the development of atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>The distinctive feature of LFC in diabetes is that the recommended exercises should be performed in a moderate (Slower) rate, as well as muscular effort. In the anaerobic organism not occur and oxidation processes that contribute to the increase of glucose by muscles.</p>

<p>Since the blood sugar level rises patient after a night&rsquo;s sleep, (which partly explains quiet sleep) are most useful gymnastics, and light walking exercise in the morning, as they not only lower blood glucose, but also promote the release of insulin in a more  But, if possible, try to exercise and in the evening (for 1.5 &ndash; 2 hours before bedtime) to secure an equivalent exercise for the day.</p>
