If the patient in time refers to the proctologist, complaining of discomfort during bowel movements, itching, cracking or bleeding from hemorrhoids, you can quickly get rid of the early stages. However, the disease often becomes extremely sleazy. Almost all patients go to the doctor already after conservative treatment of hemorrhoids is no longer effective. In this case, the doctor carefully examines the patient and determines the future strategy of the treatment of the disease. Often, the final stage of this process is the surgical treatment of hemorrhoids.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>If doctors detect external hemorrhoids requiring mechanical removal, to begin the patient is usually prescribed minimally invasive techniques that do not require surgical intervention. However, they are not suitable for all patients, so a large percentage of people suffering from hemorrhoids, gets on the operating table.</p>

<p>Do I need surgery if you have hemorrhoids? As mentioned above, the doctors try to minimize the chances of radical treatments. If there is a chance to eliminate the disease conservative or non-surgical method, the doctor uses all techniques that can have an effect. Most often, the operation shall be appointed, if a person is present hemorrhoids grade 3 complications. If the disease is the first or second step, the patient may help non-surgical hemorrhoid sclerotherapy.</p>

<h2>How do the surgery and what to choose?</h2>

<p>Today in medicine there are two main types of surgery to remove hemorrhoids. First &ndash; this is a hemorrhoidectomy for Milligan-Morgan. Second &ndash; gemorroidopeksiya by Longo. Longo operation differs from the operation of Milligan-Morgan. With this procedure, the hosts themselves are not deleted, but removes part of the rectum. By removing a portion of mucosal blood flow is disturbed nodes, whereupon they atrophy. The intervention on the Milligan-Morgan exterior and interior nodes are excised and then sewn sutures.</p>

<p>How much surgery? Data close to the end of the article. On the appropriateness of the procedure you can tell your doctor. As for the criteria for the appointment of each of the types of intervention, they can be represented as a simple table.</p>

<h2>Do I need to prepare?</h2>

<p>Preparation for surgery is performed in both cases. Both types of procedures performed in a hospital, so patients necessarily prepared for anesthesia and the surgery in advance. Hemorrhoidectomy and operation Longo require prior hospitalization. As for anesthesia, then the operation can Longo local anesthesia, although most often it is performed under general intravenous anesthesia. Hemorrhoidectomy for Milligan-Morgan performed only under intravenous anesthesia. Also, the patient can make epidural anesthesia. Local anesthesia is hardly found. Preparing for Surgery Hemorrhoids usually are not too durable, but you can not avoid this step.</p>

<h2>How long is the surgery?</h2>

<p>Another criterion &ndash; the duration of the procedure. The operation to Milligan-Morgan takes about half an hour, and the operation Longo lasts no more than twenty minutes. Tolerated both procedures are equally good, but after the surgery the patient requires medical supervision. Treatment after surgery includes preventive tools for toning the veins.</p>

<h2>Stay in a hospital</h2>

<p>After the surgery, the patient remains Longo in hospital under observation for 2-3 days. When hemorrhoidectomy hospital stay may increase up to a week. Deserve special attention, patients who develop complications of thrombosed hemorrhoids: surgery in this case should only start after the relief of the inflammatory process. Do not put the patient on the operating table during an exacerbation. It should be noted that the cost of surgery to remove hemorrhoids almost never include the cost of hospital stays. If you are being treated at a private clinic, check in advance how much are the day following hospital treatment.</p>

<h2>Terms of rehabilitation</h2>

<p>In contrast to the non-invasive techniques, after which the patient can go to work the next day, after surgical treatment of hemorrhoids patient must comply with bed rest to a week. Temporary disability after intervention by Milligan-Morgan can reach months, and after the operation is issued weekly Longo hospital.</p>

<h2>Pain</h2>

<p>How to be a painful operation? This question is asked all the patients who were prescribed surgical excision or removal of nodes of the rectal mucosa. According to experts, in operation Longo pain is negligible. In the case of the operation for Milligan-Morgan pain observed in the postoperative period in almost all patients. This procedure is a significant drawback, however, this does not diminish its effectiveness. While the patient is in the hospital, doctors removed the pain with the help of powerful analgesics. Absolutely painless surgical removal of hemorrhoids does not exist. The only option &ndash; a minimally invasive procedure. With their help, you will get a low-cost and rapid treatment of hemorrhoids &ndash; the prices of these procedures are low. However, many advanced cases surgery is the only curative treatment of the disease.</p>

<p>It should be noted also that the operation Longo is assigned only when an internal hemorrhoid. If you are running outside or combined hemorrhoids, then applied to eliminate the disease hemorrhoidectomy by Milligan-Morgan.</p>

<h2>Contra</h2>

<p>Advantage Longo operation is that it is practically no contraindications. It is quite easy to carry, even if the patient is suffering from a serious illness. With this method it is possible to eliminate even postpartum hemorrhoids.</p>

<p>As for the Milligan-Morgan, then to her, there are a range of contraindications. Among them are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>HIV;</li>
<li>Crohn&rsquo;s Disease;</li>
<li>Pregnancy and lactation</li>
<li>Cancer;</li>
<li>The aggravation of chronic diseases;</li>
<li>Acute inflammation in the body.</li>
</ul>


<h2>How much is hemorrhoid surgery?</h2>

<p>Both methods require a certain investment, but the Milligan-Morgan different low cost, unlike the method Longo, since the latter requires expensive equipment surgeons.</p>

<p>The average price for an operation to remove hemorrhoids is:</p>

<ul>
<li>The method of Longo &ndash; the cost of surgery is about $ 1,200;</li>
<li>The method of Milligan-Morgan &ndash; 650 &ndash; $ 800</li>
</ul>


<h2>Complications</h2>

<p>As with any surgical procedure, surgery to treat hemorrhoids can be followed by subsequent complications. The most common complications</p>

<ul>
<li>Bleeding</li>
<li>Rectal and vaginal fistula</li>
<li>An infectious infestation of the affected tissues</li>
