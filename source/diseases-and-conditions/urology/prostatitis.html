<h2>Overview</h2>

Prostatitis - this is one of the most common urological disease in men. It is believed that after 30 years of suffering from prostatitis, 30% of men over 40 - 40% after 50 - 50%, etc. At the same time the real incidence is much higher than registered, this is due to the peculiarities of diagnosis and the possibility of the disease in a latent form.<br>
Prostate small glandular-muscular organ that is located in the pelvis below the bladder, covering the initial division of the urethra (the urethra). The prostate gland produces a secretion that mixes with seminal fluid, supports the activity of sperm and their resistance to various unfavorable conditions.<br><br>

When prostate there are numerous problems with urination, decreased libido and erectile function is impaired. The saddest thing is that in the absence of competent treatment, about 40% of patients facing some form of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/infertility.html" title="Infertility">infertility</a>, because the prostate gland can not produce enough quality to ensure the secretion of sperm motility. It is important to remember that these symptoms can occur not only in the prostate, but also in <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/prostate-cancer.html">prostate cancer</a> and in cancer.

<h2>Causes of prostatitis</h2>

There are four basic forms of prostatitis: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, non-bacterial prostatitis and prostatodynia.<br><br>

Persons under 35 years of disease is usually in the form of acute bacterial prostatitis. Bacterial prostatitis is called when there is laboratory evidence of infection. Most often this turns out to be chlamydia, trichomoniasis, or gonorrhea gardnerellez. The infection gets into the prostate from the urethra, bladder, rectum, through the blood and lymphatic vessels of the pelvis. However, recent studies show that in most cases the infection is superimposed on the existing structure of the violation of prostate tissue and blood in it. In non-bacterial prostatitis can not identify the bacteria, although this does not exclude their presence.<br><br>

In older patients more frequently diagnosed chronic forms of the disease. Called prostatodynia the presence of clinical prostatitis and prostate tissue seal with no signs of inflammation.

<h2>Symptoms of prostatitis</h2>

Symptoms of prostatitis can be divided into three groups:<br><br>

- Disorders of the urinary system (frequent and painful urination, feeling of incomplete emptying of the bladder), pain in lower abdomen;<br>
- Disorders of sexual function (pain along the urethra and rectum during ejaculation, weak erection, premature ejaculation, loss of orgasm, etc.);<br>
- <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/increased-anxiety.html">Increased anxiety</a> and nervousness men, due to the fixation of attention on their patients condition.<br><br>

Acute prostatitis usually begins with <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a> up to 39-40 degrees with a fever and chills. Urination difficult and painful. Edema of the prostate, which can cause acute urinary retention.<br><br>

Chronic prostatitis proceeds more quietly, but at any time under unfavorable factors of aggravation may occur. Perhaps asymptomatic.

<h2>Complications</h2>

In the absence of timely treatment of prostatitis can cause the following complications:<br><br>

- The transition of acute to chronic prostatitis,<br>
- Obstruction of the urinary bladder with acute urinary retention that required surgical treatment,<br>
- Development of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/urology/male-infertility.html">male infertility</a>,<br>
- Narrowing and scarring of the urethra,<br>
- Recurrent <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/urology/cystitis.html">cystitis</a>,<br>
- <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/urology/pyelonephritis.html">Pyelonephritis</a>, and other damage to the kidneys,<br>
- Abscess (abscess) of the prostate, which requires surgical intervention,<br>
- <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/sepsis.html">Sepsis</a>, a life-threatening complication that often occurs in immunocompromised individuals (patients with diabetes mellitus, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/urology/renal-failure.html">renal failure</a>).

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

The modern arsenal of diagnostics of diseases of the prostate is very large.<br>
Your doctor will prescribe a bacteriological examination of urine and prostatic secretions. To clarify the localization of urinary tract infection is carried out a study of different portions of urine. In addition, the method of diagnosis is mandatory finger examination of the prostate gland. This procedure is not very pleasant, but very informative. The doctor may refer you to an <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/ultrasound-examination.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> of the prostate and pelvic organs. If necessary, designate a computer or magnetic nuclear imaging, cystoscopy, urography, and the study of enzymes of the prostate.<br><br>

When the diagnosis your doctor must rule out the presence of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancer</a>. For quick removal of pain in acute prostatitis can be recommended analgesics and warm baths.<br><br>

Bacterial prostatitis is necessarily require antibiotic treatment, the selection of which is based on the results of bacteriological seeding discharge on nutrient medium and determining the sensitivity of the pathogen to chemotherapy drugs.<br>
Non-bacterial prostatitis is treated with anti-inflammatory drugs.

<h2>Prevention of prostate</h2>

Do not allow overcooling of the body, do not sit on cold objects. Be sparing diet (with the exception of alcohol, spicy, fried and canned food). Regular sexual activity is also a way to prevent prostate (as one of the precipitating factors are stagnant sperm and frequent erection without ejaculation later).
