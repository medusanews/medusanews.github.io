Factors contributing to the development of pyelonephritis may include obstruction of the urinary tract in urolithiasis, frequent renal colic, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/prostate-cancer.html">prostate cancer</a> and other Pyelonephritis is divided into acute and chronic.<br>
Chronic pyelonephritis is a consequence of ineffective treatment of acute pyelonephritis, or the presence of any chronic disease.

<h2>The reasons</h2>

Causative agents of pyelonephritis are the bacteria of the genus Escherichia, Proteus, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, etc. There are rising (for urinary tract) and hematogenous (transfer of bacteria from the bloodstream of another source of infection) route of infection.

<h2>Symptoms of pyelonephritis</h2>

The clinical picture of acute or exacerbation of chronic pyelonephritis, usually takes place quickly, within a few hours. Characterized by <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a> up to 38-39 <sup>0</sup>C with chills, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headache</a>, aching muscles. After some time, joins pain in the lumbar region.

<h2>Complications</h2>

- Acute or chronic <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/urology/renal-failure.html">renal failure</a>;<br>
- A variety of suppurative disease of the kidneys (renal carbuncle, renal abscess, etc.);<br>
- <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/sepsis.html">Sepsis</a>.

<h2>Diagnosis</h2>

In the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis are important laboratory methods: a general analysis of urine, blood, urine testing for the presence of microorganisms and susceptibility of microorganisms to antibiotics.

However, antibiotics should be taken during the designated period.<br><br>

If pyelonephritis developed in the context of another kidney disease or urinary system, be sure to assigned treatment for the underlying disease.
