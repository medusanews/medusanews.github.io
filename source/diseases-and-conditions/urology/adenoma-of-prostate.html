<h2>Overview</h2>

BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) - benign tumor resulting from proliferation of the prostate tissue. It is one of the most common urogenital diseases in men.<br><br>

Prostate small glandular-muscular organ that is located in the pelvis below the bladder, covering the initial division of the urethra (the urethra). The prostate gland produces a secretion that mixes with seminal fluid, supports the activity of sperm and their resistance to various unfavorable conditions. With an enlarged <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/urology/adenoma-of-prostate.html">prostate adenoma</a> compresses the urethra, which leads to a violation of the outflow of urine from the bladder. Violation of the normal process of urination leads to stagnation of urine and as a result, the development of urolithiasis, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/urology/cystitis.html">cystitis</a>, kidney (<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/urology/pyelonephritis.html">pyelonephritis</a>), etc.<br><br>

The very enlargement of the prostate is usually painless and does not feel the patient. However, the emerging problems with urination deliver significant patient discomfort, and it is with such complaints, he turns to the doctor.

<h2>The reasons</h2>

To date, scientists have not reached a consensus on the causes of this disease. Among the possible factors not only identify the age and hormonal disorders, but also the presence of several diseases (eg atherosclerosis), a large increase in weight, age, lifestyle changes, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a>, environmental factors.<br>
Probably, BPH is a disease of age-related changes in natural hormone levels (testosterone).

<h2>Symptoms of BPH</h2>

- For the emptying of the bladder to the abdominal strain;<br>
- Urinating becomes longer, the urine implies weak, thin stream;<br>

<h2>What can your doctor?</h2>

Diagnosis of adenoma was largely based on interviews and examination of the patient. At the reception, the doctor will ask you carefully about complaints and manifestations of the disease.<br><br>

To confirm the diagnosis you can assign:<br><br>

- Digital rectal examination;<br>
- Ultrasound of the prostate;<br>
- Uroflowmetry (a method that allows us to estimate the rate of urine flow);<br>
- Cystography, aerocystography (make it possible to estimate the amount of residual urine);<br>
- Cystoscopy (if necessary);<br>
- General urine test (to determine the presence of urological infections);<br>
- Blood tests and blood tests to determine the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA).<br><br>

In order to prevent <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancer</a> of the prostate performed a <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/blood-test-total.html" title="Blood test (total)">blood test</a> for PSA and transperineal or transrectal biopsy. BPH treated conservatively (with drugs) and surgically.<br><br>

Medication brings a noticeable effect only at the initial stages of the disease, when there began the process of formation of residual urine. Drugs are assigned strictly individually, after passing the necessary examinations.<br><br>

The most effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia - surgical. There are several types of operations that are performed in the adenoma. Kind of an operation defined by the doctor.
