<h2>Overview</h2>

Kidney stones are hard, crystal-like mass. They consist of salts that are part of normal human urine in small amounts. Stones vary in size and shape. They may be tiny grains that pass unnoticed in the urine, and can be large (5 cm diameter) formations of complex shape. Usually people do not know about his disease, until the stones begin to change their position and move on urinary pathways. Even a small stone, leaving the kidneys, can cause excruciating pain.

<h2>The reasons</h2>

Most likely to develop kidney stones in humans with hereditary predisposition. Causes of salt deposits in the kidney stone formation and may be an excess of calcium or uric acid in the blood, which are caused by metabolic disorders (eg, hyperparathyroidism, excessive intake of vitamin D, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/urology/gout.html">gout</a>). The important role played by inadequate fluid intake into the body or vice versa is a great loss of fluid (eg, due to excessive use of diuretics). Both lead to the formation of very concentrated urine, which contributes to the formation of stones. When kidney infections can occur urine stasis and change its acidity. Long-term strict bed rest also contributes to the stones.

<h2>Symptoms. Kidney Stones</h2>

Usually the first symptom is a sharp stabbing pain in his back (in a sick kidney) or in the lower abdomen. The pain may spread to the groin, and accompanied by nausea and <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a>. The pain will last for as long as the stone does not come out with the urine, because the muscular wall of the ureter will try to push him out. The consequence of damage to the mucosa of the urinary tract may be the presence of blood in the urine (visible or invisible to the eye). Going down to the bladder, the stone will cause a strong urge to urinate and a burning sensation when urinating. "Exit" kidney stones (renal colic) may also be accompanied by a <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a> with chills.<br><br>
