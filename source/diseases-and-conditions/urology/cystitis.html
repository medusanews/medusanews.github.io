In his two ureters drain through which urine flows from the kidneys, and urethra of urine from the bladder out of the body surface. For accurate diagnosis the doctor will need analysis of your urine. This analysis is done to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the species of bacteria, the causative agent (to prescribe the most appropriate antibiotic).

<h2>Causes of cystitis</h2>

Usually the cause of cystitis are trapped in the bladder through the urethra bacteria. The most common pathogen is Escherichia coli (E. coli), normally detectable in the rectum, although other bacteria or disease can also cause cystitis.<br><br>

Based on the anatomy of the body, women and girls are more prone to cystitis than men. In women, the urethra is shorter and located closer to the anus, respectively, the infection is easier to penetrate into the bladder.<br><br>

Another cause of cystitis may be an inflammation of the urethra after sexual intercourse. This is caused by prolonged friction urethral opening, which may occur during sexual intercourse. Symptoms usually develop within 12 hours after intercourse.<br><br>

Sometimes cystitis ill children. In some cases this is caused by anatomical abnormalities, when the urine is thrown back into the ureters and the flow of urine through the excretory system is broken. A child with symptoms of cystitis required medical examination.<br><br>

Elderly or disabled people who find it difficult to move, may also suffer from cystitis. The reason is not completely empty the bladder, or rare urination.<br>
Children and adults who suffer too long before the act of urinating, the most prone to cystitis. In rare cases, the cystitis may be caused by a tumor.
