<h2>General</h2>
It is known that the gravity effect on blood flow. The heart acts as a pump that provides a constant circulation of blood. For circulatory organs located above the heart, gravity exerts a positive effect. However, in the legs works against gravity of the body. Sometimes failure of the venous valves or with a decrease in venous tone the force of gravity is enough to interfere with normal blood flow. This blood stagnates in the veins, resulting in the fact that the venous blood vessels themselves are deformed. These are called varicose veins.<br><br> Are usually found in the calf muscles and on the rear surface of the knee. About one in ten people in the world suffer from varicose veins. As a rule, women aged 30 to 60 years old with a birth defect of the venous valves. To bring this disease and <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="Obesity">obesity</a>, poor posture, a condition where a person has to for a long time standing or sitting, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a>. For each of these states is extra pressure on the veins and blood flow in the lower extremities is difficult.
<h2>The causes of varicose veins</h2>
- Absence of venous valves, their damage or genetic defects, so that they are not able to prevent outflow of blood return to the lower extremities which in turn is caused by gravity. Thus, overflow blood and veins dilate;<br> - A long stay in an upright position.<br> - Obesity;<br> - Increased pressure on the veins of the lower body muscle tension during a bowel movement, with weight lifting, pregnancy.
<h2>Symptoms of varicose</h2>
- Twisted, dark blue or purple flowers veins in the legs;<br> - Irregular brownish pigmentation of the skin in the legs and ankles;<br> - Intense pain in the feet<br> - Occasional occurrence of spasms in the muscles of the lower extremities<br> - Thick veins;<br> - Ulcerative defects on the skin of the feet or in the joints.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>
Without remedial measures varicose disappears. However, you are free to relieve pain and reduce the discomfort of the following ways:<br><br> Avoid prolonged standing still in one place. Without exercise in the affected blood vessels stagnates, the pressure increases. All this leads to an accumulation of water in the feet, ankles and legs of the lower part, which is accompanied by pain buildup.<br><br> Remember to move, to change body position. When walking, reduced calf muscle. In this case, the blood flows away quickly to the heart, thereby reducing the pressure in the veins. In addition, physical activity, fluid quickly absorbed by soft tissues, and thereby decrease pain.<br><br> Wear a special therapeutic stockings or socks, so you let the fluid retention in soft tissues.<br><br> Do not sleep sitting.<br><br> If you have a long time to sit, bend and unbend your legs at the ankle joint in order to maintain blood flow. In travel, pay special attention to the condition of the feet. Do not sit long in one place. Every 45-60 minutes to get up and warm up.<br> Do not sit close to the fire.

Thus, gravity drainage is lower extremities. Raise legs above heart level 3-4 times a day for 5-10 minutes. This is particularly useful for pregnant women. Do not eat a lot of salty foods, because in this case more fluid is retained in the body.
<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>
The doctor may prescribe medicines to facilitate or enhance the condition of venous tone. However, in patients with severe varicose required sclerotherapy or surgery.<br><br> Sclerotherapy is a special injection of drugs, the effect of which leads to decay and overgrown veins that prevent blood reflux with.<br><br> The surgery is the removal of varicose vein (vein excision).<br> If necessary, the doctor will prescribe treatment complications.
