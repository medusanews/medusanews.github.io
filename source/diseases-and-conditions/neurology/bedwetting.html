<h2>Overview</h2>

Bedwetting (enuresis) - is involuntary urination during sleep. This is a fairly common problem in children, teenagers and sometimes adults. Enuresis in children aged under 5 years old do not require additional examination, as it is rarely associated with serious health problems. Occasionally bedwetting can be repeated, even in children older than 5 years. However, it should not bother their parents, as this is usually temporary. Urinary incontinence in adolescents and adults is often associated with neurological disorders.

<h2>Causes of incontinence</h2>

- A nervous breakdown;<br>
- Too early or too persistent attempts to teach the child to use the potty or toilet;<br>

Try to make the toilet or potty was next to the child and that child was not afraid to go there myself.<br><br>
