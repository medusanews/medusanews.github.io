<h2>Overview</h2>

At a stroke (cerebral circulatory disorders) in certain parts of the brain blood flow is reduced or stopped altogether. Stroke is a major cause of deterioration of brain function in adults. There are two types of strokes. Ischemic stroke (cerebrovascular accident on the ischemic type) occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery or a capillary in the brain, 80% of strokes are ischemic. The second type of hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral blood flow in hemorrhagic type) occurs when the brain blood vessel bursting and <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">bleeding</a> occurs. In both cases, the damaged area of the brain cells no longer receive oxygen and nutrients they need in sufficient quantities and begin to die.

<h2>Causes of Stroke</h2>

The cause of stroke is a violation of the blood flow to certain areas of the brain due to blockage (stenosis) or rupture of cerebral arteries.<br><br>

The cause of obstruction may be:<br><br>

- Embolism (blood clot breaks away when the place of education and enters the bloodstream to the arteries of the brain, most often in sleeping);<br>
- Thrombosis (the formation of a blood clot in the vessels of the brain, usually due to atherosclerosis);<br>
Causes of cerebral artery rupture and hemorrhage are:<br>
- Hypertension;<br>
- Congenitally weak artery walls, such as an aneurysm;<br>
- Serious injury (such as a severe blow to the head during a traffic accident).

<h2>Symptoms of Stroke</h2>

When you see the following symptoms should immediately call an ambulance:<br><br>

- Occurrence of sudden weakness, numbness or paralysis of the muscles of the face, arm or leg, usually on one side of the body;<br>
- Unusual difficulty or speech-impaired;<br>
- Rapid deterioration of vision in one or both eyes;<br>
- Unexpected gait disturbance, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/dizziness.html">dizziness</a>, loss of balance or coordination;<br>
- Severe <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headache</a> with no known reasons.<br><br>

Short-term ischemic attacks are microstroke (transient transient cerebral ischemic attack). Symptoms of it are the same as that of the normal stroke but the duration of a few minutes. If you suspect yourself or your loved ones microstroke, you must seek immediate medical attention.

<h2>Complications</h2>

A stroke can lead to further prolonged coma, paralysis or paresis (muscle weakness) of the muscles on one side or part of the body, mentally and / or memory. Severe stroke can cause death.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

If you are an observer, and you think that a man stroke, if after a <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/head-injury.html">head injury</a> in humans marked <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a> or weakness, call an ambulance.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

If you suspect a stroke, the patient must undergo a hospital examination and treatment.<br>
In the diagnosis is commonly used computed tomography, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/magnetic-resonance-imaging.html" title="Magnetic Resonance Imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a> and other studies.<br><br>

You may need surgery to remove a blood clot, or hematoma, bleeding stops.<br>
After a stroke, nearly all patients need rehabilitation. In restoring the lost stroke speech and motor skills may help moderate exercise, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.

<h2>Preventive measures</h2>

Regularly measure your blood pressure. If you suffer from hypertension, try to follow the doctor's recommendations and to control blood pressure. In ischemic <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/heart-disease.html" title="Heart Disease">heart disease</a> obey diet and be active enough.<br><br>

Control your blood sugar levels.<br>
Give up smoking.
