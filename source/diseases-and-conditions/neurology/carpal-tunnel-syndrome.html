<h2>Overview</h2>

Carpal tunnel syndrome - a condition characterized by pain, tingling, numbness and other symptoms in the wrist and hand. Pain and other symptoms occur in the median nerve, which provides a sensitivity in the fingers and the thumb controls.

<h2>Causes of carpal tunnel syndrome</h2>

The immediate cause of carpal tunnel syndrome, compression of the median nerve at the wrist where the nerve passes through the tunnel (carpal tunnel), forming pits the wrist and the transverse carpal ligament. Various situations can lead to inflammation and swelling within the joints, tendons, and muscles within the carpal tunnel. Most often this work, which requires frequent repetitive motion. Working at a computer, typists, pianists, and meat packers particularly susceptible. The other states include:

- Arthritis or other rheumatic conditions affecting the hand and wrist area;<br>
- Wrist injury;<br>
- Activities that require strong compression or capture;<br>
- <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">Pregnancy</a> or contraceptive use (in both cases it is possible fluid retention and swelling of the hands);<br>
- Swelling of the median nerve;<br>
- Diabetes;<br>
- Diseases of the thyroid gland;<br>
- <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/endocrinology/acromegaly.html">Acromegaly</a> (a rare disease characterized by abnormal increase in the brush).

<h2>Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome</h2>

Diagnosis is based on an analysis of the movement that provokes symptoms, if there is compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. The presence of carpal tunnel syndrome showed positive tests Tinelya (light tapping over the place of the passage of the median nerve at the wrist, accompanied by a sensation of tingling in the fingers and palms) and Falena (at maximum flexion of the wrist for about 3 minutes there is mild pain and tingling in the palmar surface of the thumb, index, middle, and partly - ring fingers).<br><br>

In the initial stage the symptoms are vague and there are painful for a few months. At their first appearance they do not arouse suspicion, and medical assistance is required only when they become more pronounced. Symptoms are characterized by constant and severe pain. If untreated, there is a gradual weakening and exhaustion of the muscles of the thumb.

<h2>Complications</h2>

From a medical point of view of carpal tunnel syndrome is not a serious health hazard, but it can severely restrict daily activity and may require changes in the nature of work. We recommend early treatment to avoid irreversible nerve damage.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

It should distribute its activity during the day so as to avoid situations that can trigger symptoms. For example, if you write or print, the brush will be in a bent position is quite long, which creates additional pressure on the median nerve. You must regularly take breaks and keep the wrist at rest. For homework to avoid ironing.<br><br>

If the swelling in the wrist associated with the use of oral contraceptives, you should consider other methods of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/contraception.html" title="Contraception">contraception</a>.<br>
If you have symptoms characteristic of carpal tunnel syndrome, see your doctor, if possible, as soon as possible. With early diagnosis and timely treatment initiated there is a possibility of full recovery. Delay of treatment, however, increases the risk of irreversible nerve damage.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

First, the doctor will conduct tests and Tinelya Falena. Additional tests may include the study of nerve conduction velocity, which is measured by the ability of the nerve to send electrical impulses to the brain. <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/x-rays.html" title="X-rays">X-rays</a> of hands and blood tests also can be carried out to establish the presence of other factors that may cause this condition.<br><br>

The imposition of the tire on the wrist at night helps keep the wrist in the unbent state, which helps to reduce puffiness.<br><br>

To reduce swelling, pain and pressure on the nerve can be assigned to aspirin or other NSAIDs. If these drugs are ineffective, then we can apply the cortisone injections.<br>
If conservative treatments have failed, you may need surgery to avoid nerve damage (the operation is to enhance the release of the carpal tunnel and median nerve).
