In addition, due to cytotoxic therapy doctors have learned to successfully treat systemic tumors such as leukemia and other blood diseases.

<h2>The mechanism of action</h2>

The basis of most chemotherapeutic drugs is their ability to stop the most important biological processes in tumor cells. They act on cells in various stages of the cell cycle, stopping the process of division and growth. Often, to maximize the effectiveness of treatment program consists of a combination of chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action. Sometimes also used a combination of different methods of treatment: chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgical techniques.

Particularly vulnerable organs and tissues, where cells divide rapidly: the hair follicles of the skin, bone marrow, gastro-intestinal tract. It now becomes clear, as there are well-known side effects of cancer chemotherapy such as hair loss, changes in cellular composition of blood (and is connected with this tendency to frequent infections and <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">bleeding</a>), mucous membranes of the mouth and vagina, bowel problems and other common complication chemotherapy is nausea and <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a>.<br><br>
