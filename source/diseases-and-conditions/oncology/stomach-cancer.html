It is understood that there are a number of variants of this tumor. They differ in morphology, location, propensity to metastasize and the prognosis.

<h2>Causes of cancer of the stomach</h2>

At the moment, doctors do not have a clear position on the causes of stomach cancer, but we can say with great certainty about the risk factors of this disease. These include:<br><br>

- Exposure to carcinogens (preservatives, nitrosamines, extremely rough, smoked, fat, Refried or spicy food);<br>
- Infectious factor (Helicobacter Pylori infection, a favorite habitat of which is the stomach);<br>
- Alcohol abuse and smoking;<br>
- A hereditary factor.<br><br>

For precancerous conditions include chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric ulcer, pernicious anemia, a condition after gastrectomy, gastric polyps, etc.
In recent years there has been reduction in the incidence of gastric cancer in developed countries. This is due primarily to the conduct of a healthy nutrition policy: improved conditions for food storage instead of smoking, salting and pickling, leading to an accumulation of carcinogens, often are used by freezing, increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables.

<h2>Symptoms of stomach cancer</h2>

Unfortunately, the early stages of stomach cancer is almost never seen. The first symptoms are not specific to weakness, fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite. With the increase in tumor pain may appear in the upper abdomen, a feeling of fullness after eating, nausea, belching, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a>.
