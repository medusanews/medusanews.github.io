<h2>Overview</h2>

Hodgkin's disease or Lymphogranulomatosis - a malignant tumor of lymphoid tissue with a specific histologic structure. Microscopic examination of affected tissues are granulomas containing cells Berezovsky-Sternberg-Reed. For the first time the disease was described by English physician T. Hodgkin's in 1832.<br><br>

Hodgkin's disease often occurs in childhood, and has a peak incidence at 20 and 50 years

<h2>The causes of the disease</h2>

The etiology of Hodgkin's disease is unknown. However, discusses the role of Epstein-Barr virus, which is often found in tumor cells in this disease. Perhaps, this infection leads to some mutations in normal human lymphocytes, as a result they begin to multiply uncontrollably.

<h2>Symptoms of Hodgkin's disease</h2>

The main symptom is a swollen lymph node adenopathy. Lymph nodes are painless, firm, mobile, with no signs of inflammation, often in the form of conglomerates. Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin noticeable to the touch, and sometimes visually. Due to the fact that often the affected lymph tissue located in the chest, the first symptom may be shortness of breath or <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/cough.html">coughing</a> due to pressure on the lungs and bronchial lymph nodes.<br><br>

Other symptoms occurring with chlamydia are weak, a long unreasoning <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a>, sweats, weight loss (more than 10% of body weight in 6 months or less).

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

If you or a person close to you diagnosed "Hodgkin" should start treatment immediately and act in accordance with the recommendations of a physician.
Modern methods of treatment can achieve good results even with large amounts of tumor tissue.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

Depending on the clinical symptoms and the localization of the pathological process for diagnosis and determination of treatment can be selected by various methods. The required tests include general and biochemical blood tests, chest radiography in frontal and lateral views, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/ultrasound-examination.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> examination of peripheral lymph nodes, abdomen and pelvis. The final diagnosis should be histological sample of tumor tissue obtained at biopsy of a lymph node. This tissue is sent to the morphological and immunohistochemical study.<br><br>

After the diagnosis the doctor will determine the form and stage of disease. Depending on these parameters, select a treatment program. It may consist of various combinations of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The prognosis of Hodgkin depends primarily on the stage of the process, which started treatment, as well as the histology of the tumor. According to world statistics Hodgkin's disease can be cured in 60-80% of patients.
