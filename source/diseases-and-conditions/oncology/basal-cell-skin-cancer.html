<h2>Overview</h2>

Basal cell <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/skin-cancer.html">skin cancer</a> is the most common malignant disease of the skin. The tumor develops from the cells of the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis. Incidence increases with age. People with fair skin are suffering from this disease more often than blacks. We prove a direct link between the time being under the direct rays of the sun and the frequency of basal cell <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancer</a>. People who work outdoors or who live in areas with high solar radiation have an increased risk of disease.

<h2>The causes of the disease</h2>

The cause of any malignant disease is damage to the genetic material of cells, which occurs under the influence of various environmental factors and leads to uncontrolled growth and proliferation of abnormal tissue.<br><br>
Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include:<br><br>

- Excessive insolation;<br>
- Light skin color;<br>
- Old age;<br>
- Receiving immunosuppressive drugs.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

Basal cell skin cancers usually occur on exposed skin, such as the head, face, neck, arms and torso, which fall on the sun's rays. Depending on the clinical form of disease of basal cell carcinoma may appear as reddish scaly erosion, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">bleeding</a> ulcers, pigmented lesions, small pearl-pink node with ulceration in the center of a dense yellowish waxy plaque, etc.<br><br>

Skin cancer may resemble superficially <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/dermatology/dermatitis.html" title="Dermatitis">dermatitis</a> and other inflammatory skin changes. That is why the appearance of any new growths on the skin, does not fade with time (over 2-3 weeks), you must apply to the dermatologist.

<h2>Treatment</h2>

Basal cell skin cancer respond well to treatment and rarely metastasizes. Therefore, if a timely appeal to the physician and compliance with all of its recommendations the patient has a chance of full recovery.<br><br>

The choice of method of treatment depends on the histological variants and localization of the tumor. As a rule, use the various options of surgical treatment (electrocoagulation, excision, cryosurgery) and <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/radiation-therapy.html">radiation therapy</a>. In some cases, the use of chemo-and immunotherapy.

<h2>Metastases</h2>

The tumor is characterized by slow growth. The frequency of metastasis does not exceed 0.1%. The risk of recurrence and metastasis are dependent on the location, histologic tumor characteristics and condition of the body.

<h2>Prevention of basal cell skin cancer</h2>

Most malignant tumors of the skin caused by prolonged exposure to UV irradiation and prevention boils down to limiting the impact of this: we should not get involved in a solarium, a long time under the bright sun, especially during midday hours. Traveling to hot countries try to wear light clothes bright closed.
If you or your immediate family ever been treated for malignant tumors of the skin, try to visit a dermatologist regularly for checkups.
