<h2>Overview</h2>

In the overall structure of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancer</a> on the incidence of malignant skin tumors occupy third place. Among the malignant tumors of the skin occurs most frequently basal cell carcinoma is much rarer - squamous cell carcinoma, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/melanoma.html">melanoma</a>, and tumors developing from skin appendages.<br><br>

Skin cancer occurs predominantly in the open parts of the body, more than 70% of tumors developed on his face. Favorite places of location of the tumor is the forehead, nose, corners of the eyes, temple area and ears.

<h2>The reasons</h2>

The reasons for the development of squamous and basal cell cancer of the skin are unknown. Risk factors for skin cancer is excessive insolation, ionizing radiation, and exposure to various chemical carcinogens that fall on the skin, including tobacco smoke carcinogens. The probability of disease increases with age. Men and women suffer with approximately equal frequency. Risk factors may also include reduced immunity, which explains the higher incidence of skin cancer with <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/aids.html">AIDS</a> and patients on immunosuppressive therapy. Matters and family history. There are a number of pre-cancerous conditions, such as solar keratosis and Bowen's disease.

<h2>Symptoms of skin cancer</h2>

Depending on the form of skin cancer may appear as surface erosion, plaque, or a node. Often asymptomatic, but may be ulceration, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">bleeding</a> and pain.

<h2>Complications</h2>

Squamous cell carcinoma metastasizes much more basal. Most often found in metastatic lymph nodes. Metastases significantly impair the prognosis of the disease.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

In case of skin on the surface of suspicious items, try not to delay the appeal to the dermatologist. If necessary, you will be referred to a medical oncologist.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

Diagnosis of skin cancer based on histological examination of suspicious areas of the skin. If necessary, conduct additional studies to clarify the diagnosis and detection of possible metastases. Treatment of skin cancer primarily surgical. This may be a classical excision, cryosurgery tumor electrocoagulation. As an additional method used by <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/radiation-therapy.html">radiation therapy</a>. Prognosis for early detection of cancer is favorable. 5-year survival is 95%.

<h2>Prophylaxis</h2>

Prevention of skin cancer is to reduce the impact of physical and chemical carcinogens on the skin (the rejection of excess solar ultraviolet radiation, smoking cessation, limiting exposure to carcinogenic substances that fall on the skin). Requires regular use of sunscreens and nutrients, prompt treatment of precancerous lesions, nonhealing scars, strict personal hygiene measures when working with substances containing carcinogens. Individuals with a family history of skin cancer need regular checkups oncologist.
