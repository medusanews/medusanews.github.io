A cancerous tumor grows slowly, and the disease may not manifest themselves for many years. But even a small tumor in some cases it may begin to spread to other organs (metastasis often fall into the bone - pelvis, hip, spine, and in the lungs, liver, adrenal glands).

<h2>The reasons</h2>

The causes of the disease may not be established. However, at present known to some of the factors that increase the likelihood of developing this disease. The risk of disease increases with age. According to some reports increased consumption of foods high in animal fat increases the risk of several of the disease, as well as inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables. Regular physical activity while maintaining normal weight can reduce the risk of prostate cancer. The presence of close relatives of prostate cancer increases the risk of developing prostate cancer. There are also suggestions that vasectomy increases the risk of several cancers of the prostate. Found that the development of prostate cancer associated with hormonal changes in older men (in particular, high - testosterone male sex hormone). Tumor growth is stimulated by testosterone, therefore, men with higher levels of testosterone in the blood of prostate cancer is more likely with more severe disease course.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

All men over age 50 should do an annual test to determine blood PSA (prostate-specific antigen), the number is in the blood increases dramatically with the development of malignant tumors of the prostate. It should be noted that at present it is practically the only way to detect the disease at an early stage when it can still be removed.<br><br>

If successful, the operation in the early stages of the disease we can talk about complete recovery.<br><br>

Modern medicine has developed various methods of drug therapy (primarily hormonal). Hormonal drugs can reduce the rate of tumor growth and metastasis.<br><br>

<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/radiation-therapy.html">Radiation therapy</a> is the irradiation of the prostate with radioactive radiation. In some cases, radiation and drug therapy are used together.<br><br>
