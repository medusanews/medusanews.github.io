On the other hand, if the allergen is ordinary dust or animal hair, the disease is less severe, but throughout the year.<br><br>
Allergic rhinitis often appears with vasomotor rhinitis, when the nose is very sensitive to irritants such as cigarette smoke, air pollutants other agents, changes in temperature and humidity, certain foods, medications and emotional <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a>. Also increase the risk of allergic rhinitis, other allergic diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis.<br><br>

<h2>The causes of rhinitis</h2>
The cause of the allergic rhinitis is usually pollen, fungi, hair, pet dander, dust. These substances are harmless to most people, but if inhaled allergies they cause exaggerated immune response. This starts a cascade of biochemical reactions, which results in a massive release into the blood histamine and other chemicals that cause inflammation and mucus in the nasal passages and sinuses.

Effective these drugs and the concomitant allergic conjunctivitis.<br><br>
To the basic therapies also relates allergen-specific immunotherapy, which can increase the duration of remission (absence of symptoms) to a few years, to reduce the need for medication for the season allergen exposure, prevents migration of allergic rhinitis asthma.
