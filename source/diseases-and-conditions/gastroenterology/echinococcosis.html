<h2>General</h2>
Echinococcosis (Hydatid disease) - a disease of humans and animals caused by parasitizing larvae of the tapeworm Echinococcus. Infection of humans occurs by ingestion of helminth eggs mainly due to contact with the dogs.
<h2>Causes of the disease</h2>
Adult tapeworm tapeworm parasites in the intestines of dogs and rodents, where they lay their eggs, which are excreted in the faeces into the environment. Failure to comply with hygiene after contact with these animals helminth eggs can get into the gastro-intestinal tract of man. In the intestine, the larvae from eggs that penetrate the blood vessels and entered into various organs, turning it into hydatid cyst - Finns. Finn is a bubble of thick, double-walled shell, in which the parasite develops. Finns are found most frequently in the liver and lung at least - in the brain. Over time, the Finns increase in size, begin to compress the surrounding tissue and disrupt the normal functioning of the organs.
<h2>Symptoms of echinococcosis</h2>
The disease is usually asymptomatic for a long time. Most cyst detected during preventive examination by X-ray or ultrasound. With an increase in the size of the cyst symptoms associated with compression of the surrounding organs and tissues.<br><br> If the location of the liver, pain of varying intensity in the right upper quadrant, a feeling of heaviness, pressure, weakness, malaise, fatigue, decreased activity, and sometimes allergic reactions, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/jaundice.html">jaundice</a>.

<h2>Diagnosis of echinococcosis</h2>
For the diagnosis of echinococcosis uses imaging research methods - X-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI. Needle biopsy of the cyst is considered a dangerous procedure, because during it can happen parasites spread to the surrounding tissues. Immunological methods provide little information.
<h2>Treatment of echinococcosis</h2>
The treatment depends on the location of the parasite, the clinical picture and the patient's general condition. Surgical intervention, if possible is the primary method of treatment. At the same time produce a cyst removal suturing cavity remaining after her.
<h2>Prevention</h2>
Must strictly observe good personal hygiene when maintenance of dogs and care for them: be sure to wash your hands after contact with a dog, do not allow dogs to human food and its container, carry out preventive treatment (de-worming) pets.
