Helicobacter pylori - a bacterium that feeds on human gastric mucosa. These bacteria are capable of producing and releasing a large amount of enzymes and toxins, which promote mucosal cell damage that can lead to inflammatory and ulcerous diseases of the stomach and duodenum. It is known that almost 60% of the world's population are infected with Helicobacter pylori. Therefore, not every infected person gets sick stomach ulcer, but in most cases of this infection is detected. Now it is proved that the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection in inflammatory diseases of the stomach and duodenum is an indication for antibiotic therapy.
<h2>Causes of the disease</h2>
Helicobacter pylori is found only in the human stomach. Infection occurs through contact with an infected person. Transmission can occur oral-oral route through kissing or using the same dishes, as well as through hygiene. As a rule, all family members are infected with one strain of Helicobacter pylori, which proves the contact-household transmission.
<h2>The symptoms of the disease</h2>
In many cases, the infection may be asymptomatic. Detection of Helicobacter pylori in the absence of inflammatory diseases of the stomach or intestine is not an indication for antibiotic therapy.<br><br> In the development against the background of Helicobacter pylori infection inflammatory disease (gastric or duodenal ulcer, erosive gastritis, gastro) clinical disease will fit.
<h2>Diagnostics</h2>
Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection is possible using a number of methods that can detect microorganism itself, signs of life, or immunological response to infection (antibodies in the serum). Typically, the patient is sent for analysis when an active inflammatory process in the stomach or intestine dvenadtsatperstnoy.<br><br> 1) Detection of H. pylori-specific antibodies of the patient's blood.<br> 2) Breathing tests with the registration of waste products (carbon dioxide, ammonia)<br> 3) Detection of bacterial DNA by PCR in the analysis of feces, saliva, dental plaque.<br> 4) The discovery of microorganisms in the microscopic study of mucosal biopsy specimens taken at FEGDS.
<h2>Treatment</h2>
Diagnosis and treatment of this infection has been gastroenterologist.<br> Detection of Helicobacter pylori infection in the absence of inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract is not an indication for treatment.<br><br> For the treatment of Helicobacter pylori developed several therapeutic regimens comprising one, two or three of antibacterial drug (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, furazolidone, etc.) antisecretory agents (omeprazole, ranitidine), and bismuth preparations..
