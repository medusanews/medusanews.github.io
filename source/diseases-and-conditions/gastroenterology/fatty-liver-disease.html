<h2>General</h2>
The liver is actively involved in the metabolism of fats. Fats from food in the gut cleaved by enzymes and absorbed into the bloodstream. From there they get to the liver, where they are converted into triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids and other necessary substances for our body. Fatty liver accumulation occurs in the case of high hepatic triglycerides. When fatty triglycerides can reach more than 50% of its mass (normally no more than 5%). The factors leading to this condition are varied: enhanced delivery of fatty acids to food, increased formation of triglycerides in the liver, disturbance of liver triglyceride in adipose tissue triglycerides wherein normally stored as fat. Depending on the fat-fatty liver is divided into the coarse and atomized (the size of the fat droplets in the liver).
<h2>Causes of the disease</h2>
Alcohol abuse is the most common cause of fatty liver. Ethyl alcohol and its metabolic products affect all stages exchanges fat in the liver. The severity of steatosis is directly proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed.<br> Mellitus.<br> <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="Obesity">Obesity</a> and high fat intake from food.<br> Protein deficiency syndrome, Kwashiorkor (accumulation of fat in the liver due to the insufficient amount of protein and impaired transport of fats from the liver to the tissues).<br> Poison hepatotropic poisons (carbon tetrachloride, DDT, yellow phosphorus, etc.).<br> The use of certain medications.
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Patients with fatty liver complaints usually do not show. The disease is worn out, slowly progressing. Since there are constant dull pain in the right upper quadrant, may be nausea, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a>, and violations of the chair.<br><br> Very rarely observed fatty liver disease with severe clinical picture: severe <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/abdominal-pain.html">abdominal pain</a>, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/jaundice.html">jaundice</a>, weight loss, itchy skin.
<h2>Diagnostics</h2>
To suspect steatosis physician therapist may have a clinical examination by an increase in the size of the liver by abdominal palpation. Enlargement of the liver was confirmed by <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/ultrasound-examination.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> examination of the abdomen. In the biochemical analysis of blood detected elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase). In some cases, to confirm the diagnosis of a CT, MRI, a biopsy of the liver.
<h2>Treatment</h2>
The tactics of treatment depends on the cause of the disease. Proper diet, avoiding alcohol, correction of metabolic disorders, tend to lead to improvement. Appoint a diet with a high content of protein, reduced fat, especially animal fats.
