<h2>General</h2>
Candidiasis - a disease caused by a yeast-like fungi of the genus Candida, mainly Candida albisans.<br><br> Candida albicans is often present inside the human body (at 30% of the population) in a small amount, for example in the oral cavity, vagina, and intestine without causing any problems. Therefore, babies can become infected when tested at birth through the vagina.<br><br> At risk are:<br><br> - People with a weakened immune system and a low number of white blood cells in the blood, such as patients with <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/aids.html">AIDS</a>, leukemia (leukemia) or patients treated for <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancer</a><br> - Patients with diabetes<br> - The pregnant women<br> - People who use potent drugs (including antibiotics, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids).
<h2>Causes of candidiasis</h2>
A healthy immune system and normal gut flora and vaginal inhibit the growth of Candida albicans, and usually the person did not cause any discomfort associated with its presence in the body.<br><br> Sometimes the body produce conditions favorable to the growth and reproduction of these organisms (in this case, and there is a <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/stomatology/thrush-in-children-candidiasis.html">thrush</a>). The favorable conditions include the violation of the integrity of the skin and mucous membranes, decreased immunity of the person, changing acidity of the vagina, sweating, high ambient humidity and warm.
<h2>Symptoms of candidiasis</h2>
The fungus can infect the skin and mucous membranes. Most often it is the mucous membranes of the mouth (oral candidiasis) of the cavity, the intestines and the vagina (<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/vaginal-candidiasis.html" title="Vaginal candidiasis">vaginal candidiasis</a>), skin folds under the breasts in obese women, or foreskin of uncircumcised men so is areas where it is warm and humid.
<h2>What you can do?</h2>
Candida albicans is found in the body in the normal state, and thus get rid of it completely impossible. The main aim here is to keep it under control so that it did not breed very much.
<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>
The physician should make a diagnosis, to determine the possible cause of candidiasis and assign therapy. Typically used antifungals such as fluconazole, clotrimazole and miconazole. They can be written Dr, and some are available without a prescription. However, prior to the start of treatment, consult your doctor.<br><br> If candidiasis occurs frequently (2-3 times a year), be sure to discuss treatment options with your doctor, because there are several ways that you can reduce the likelihood of recurrence thrush.
<h2>Preventative measures</h2>
As mentioned earlier, there are some factors that make people susceptible to thrush. Of course, patients with diabetes, AIDS or leukemia should always be treated (which it prescribed by a doctor).<br><br> The rest should follow certain rules that will help prevent the occurrence and recurrence of thrush.<br><br> Thus, the maintenance of the body dry and ventilation (air bath) reduce the probability of rapid multiplication of Candida albicans. Eating live yoghurt containing acidophilus cultures or acidophilus supplements (containing harmless lactic acid bacteria) should enhance the growth of the normal flora of humans and prevent the proliferation of Candida.
