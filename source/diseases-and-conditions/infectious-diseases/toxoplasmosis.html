Toxoplasma can enter directly into the blood of a person through broken skin or transmitted by blood-sucking insects. Finally, there are cases of intrauterine infection and.<br><br> Factors that may contribute to the appearance of the parasite in the body and increase the risk of toxoplasmosis:<br><br> Touching dirty hands to the mouth after contact with the ground, after cleaning the litter box, or any other contact with cat feces.<br> Take in food raw or not fully cooked meat, especially pork, lamb or venison.<br> Touching the mouth after contact with raw or neprozharennoe / undercooked meat.<br> Organ transplant or blood transfusion (very rare).<br> If a woman is pregnant, and she became infected with toxoplasmosis, an infection can be passed from her child, which can lead to serious consequences.

But this is possible only when the mother becomes infected with toxoplasmosis during pregnancy. If she contracted before pregnancy, the unborn baby is not in danger.<br><br> In congenital toxoplasmosis organ damage is significant. Thus, there may be congenital malformations of the eyeball, until the development of blindness, underdevelopment of the brain and spinal cord. The severity of the fetus is closely linked with the timing of pregnancy - the younger the fetus, the harder the disease.<br><br> As a result of congenital toxoplasmosis fetus or die as a result of a malformation incompatible with life, or is born with symptoms of severe congenital toxoplasmosis - intoxication, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a>, yellowness, lesions of the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and central nervous system (encephalomyelitis).<br><br> But toxoplasmosis can affect fruit only once, all subsequent pregnancy are safe formed antibodies in the mother.
<h3>Acquired toxoplasmosis</h3>
Acquired toxoplasmosis often occurs in the latent (hidden) form; acute form can resemble a fever or encephalitis, frequent damage to eyes. Acute stage lasts about 7 days. Acute toxoplasmosis begins with a high fever, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headache</a>, seizures, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a>. Increased liver and spleen may join <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/pneumonia.html">pneumonia</a> and paralysis.<br><br> The most common form of the disease is chronic, long before the rise in temperature 37,2-37,8 degrees, headaches, enlarged liver, spleen, lymph nodes, muscle and joint pain. It is also possible carrier of infection.<br><br> The chronic form, and frequently become carriers of the acute form of the <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a>, pregnancy, reduced immunity of different nature. On the severity of symptoms of toxoplasmosis significantly affect overall health, immune status. In individuals with immunodeficiency (including <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/aids.html">AIDS</a>), the disease is extremely difficult, often fatal.
<h2>Prevention of toxoplasmosis</h2>
Good hygiene when preparing food - one of the main measures of protection against infection.<br><br> Given the possibility of sexual transmission of infection appropriate use of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/barrier-methods-of-contraception.html" title="Barrier methods of contraception">barrier methods of contraception</a>, antiseptic sprays.
