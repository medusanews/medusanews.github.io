The essence of a strict diet is to get no more than 1,000 calories a day, and often even less than about 500 calories. The menu gives a very poor, with a limited set of products. Observe a strict diet usually no more than 2 weeks, since in the longer term the body begins to lack of vitamins, minerals, protein, fat or other substances required, depending on the type of diet. However, contrary to popular opinion, most people, the effectiveness of dieting is most often very small.<br><br> The brevity of a strict diet and is usually limited and unusual set of products authorized for use, do not create the conditions for changing eating habits for the better. Moreover, because of the extreme conditions after getting rid of extra pounds (even if it took place) is usually very difficult to maintain weight.<br><br> Consider the mechanism of losing the excess pounds, subject to a strict diet. The main reason for weight loss is a significant decrease in the body of glycogen and water, as well as a certain amount of protein. As a result, although a person loses weight by approximately 3 to 5 kg during the first week and for 2 more 3kg after the second week of dieting, the lost weight quickly returned when filling water and lack of glycogen in the body. Loss of actual fat from which overweight people are so eager to get rid of, is very small. In addition, people are starved after a strict diet, then begin to feed heavily, thereby filling a rapid fat loss and delay of new reserves. Not to mention the fact that a huge number of people still in the process of sitting on a strict diet is not maintained and break down, emptying the fridge at night or hastily eating a hot dog on the street.<br><br> Of course, the major drawback to a strict diet is that it is difficult to implement in practice. Even partial refusal of food can be unbearable because of the limited number of products, because of tasteless meals, inability to get any pleasure from food and just because of hunger. When calorie diet does not exceed 500 calories per day, the body does not receive the necessary nutrients from the body begins to lose protein. Especially dangerous for the health strict diet, which, along with the restriction of food and drinking water limit.<br><br> Strict diet because of the stressful conditions and low efficiency when hard-lost pounds quickly come back again, often badly affect the psychological state of the person, undermine his confidence and ability to lose weight, make us think that all efforts are in vain.<br><br> Nutritionists advise wishing to lose weight to abandon the practice of short-term rigid diets, in particular mono-diet (ie, Diets with use of one main product, where "sit" on the buckwheat for kefir on apples, etc.). If you like the idea of mono, it is better to arrange fasting diet on fruits and vegetables, fresh juices, or on the same kefir. But such fasting days, of course, does not completely solve the problem of excess weight, they are not likely to get better help to keep a steady weight.<br><br> If necessary, a major adjustment of body weight, it is necessary to completely revise your diet once and for all. A strict diet or fasting (which can be done only under the supervision of a doctor!) For 1, 2 or 3 weeks will not solve the problem, most likely, will only aggravate it, have a negative impact on your health and psychological condition.<br><br> Remember that to lose weight fast (more than 3 kg per month) - is harmful and dangerous to the body. Far better to get rid of excess weight gradually, gradually changing their eating habits and always doing physical exercises. Pounds lost so much less likely to come back.<br><br> Avoid low-calorie and low-carbohydrate diets. Your diet should be balanced, because your goal to lose weight, not undermine health. It is best to reduce the intake of fat and simple carbohydrates.<br><br> In the diet should include fresh and cooked vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, dairy products with low-fat, lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs and nuts. Avoid fried, salty, white bread and sweet baked goods. Do not limit yourself to the liquid, but be cautious in their use of alcohol. Eat slowly, 3-4 times a day and at night overeat. And be sure to move walk, swim, go in any kind of sports, yoga, fitness - all that you like.<br><br> These seemingly truisms familiar to everyone watching their diet, in fact the only true, effective and healthy way to correct overweight.
