<h2>Power supply beyond the period of exacerbation</h2> Allergic diseases are a large group of diseases, and includes such serious conditions as angioedema, anaphylactic shock, bronchial asthma and less life-threatening diseases (allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, etc.). For some of these diseases will be exactly a factor provoking foods. For other more important allergens such as pollen, animal dander, dust, etc. It is clear that dietary advice to so many different diseases to be significantly different. However, there are a number of recommendations that will be useful to everyone.<br><br> 1) Check with your allergist exact list of "allowed" and "forbidden" foods. Possible, to determine if you will have a specific allergen skin scarification conduct tests or analysis on specific IgE in serum.<br> 2) It is with great care to try new foods. It is better if you do it at home and under the care of family members who can help in case of an allergy.<br> 3) Cook the food yourself from the source of raw foods. Meat and fish are buying only a piece.<br> 4) Avoid the use of semi-finished products, canned products, mayonnaise and other sauces. You can never be completely sure of the composition of the acquired finished goods.<br> 5) Study the composition of any prepared food that you are going to eat.<br><br> These recommendations relate to both children and adults. If your child suffers from allergies, you need to carefully monitor his diet. All relatively easy until the baby is small and does not attend school or daycare. As soon as the child grows up and becomes self-reliance, it becomes more difficult to control. Explain to your child what foods he can eat and which are not. In this case, you should choose the form of dialogue that the child knew that your instructions it is not my "mother's whim" but a necessity. If the "forbidden" foods have a lot of sense to write them down on a card and give the child with him. The barmaid and the teachers at the school must also have an idea about the problem of your child. If you are not sure of the quality of school breakfasts, a child should be prepared meals at home and give to the other in a plastic container.
<h2>Food for exacerbations of allergic diseases</h2> As already mentioned, the physiological characteristic of people suffering from any allergic disease is their initial inclination to the diverse manifestations of allergy.
