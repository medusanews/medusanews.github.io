<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/acquired-valvular-heart-disease.html" title="Acquired valvular heart disease">Acquired valvular heart disease</a><br> Acquired heart disease - is a morphological change of heart valve that has developed over the life of the patient as a result of disease or traumatic injury of the heart. Up to 90% of acquired heart have rheumatic character. Valvular lead to increased load on the corresponding side of the heart, myocardial hypertrophy and eventually to heart failure.<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/angina.html" title="Angina">Angina</a><br> Heart attack (angina) occurs when a particular portion of the heart muscle with blood is not delivered necessary quantity of oxygen, which leads to damage or necrosis of the weakening area. Although heart attacks usually develop suddenly, heart damage may develop gradually over several years. Most heart attacks are caused by blockage or spasm of the coronary arteries (blood vessels that supply the heart). Usually clogged arteries in atherosclerosis.<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/arrhythmias.html" title="Arrhythmias">Arrhythmias</a><br> Arrhythmias - a group of common diseases of the cardiovascular system, characterized by a change in the frequency or regularity of heartbeats. Arrhythmias are divided into tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), bradycardia (slow heart rate), arrythmia (sudden contraction) and heart block (in case of blockade of impulse can not pass through certain areas of the heart muscle and reducing the different chambers of the heart do not take place in a coordinated).<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/atherosclerosis.html" title="Atherosclerosis">Atherosclerosis</a><br> Atherosclerosis - one of the most pressing diseases of the twentieth century, one of the four most common diseases and causes of death. Misuse, improper diet, lack of exercise, stress - all this leads to atherosclerosis.<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/congenital-heart-disease-chd.html" title="Congenital heart disease (CHD)">Congenital heart disease (CHD)</a><br> Congenital heart disease - is caused in utero (before birth) anatomic defects of the heart, its valve apparatus or its vessels. Congenital heart defects occur with a frequency of 6-8 cases per thousand births, accounting for 30% of all malformations. They occupy the first place in infant mortality and children in the first year of life.<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/congestive-heart-failure.html" title="Congestive heart failure">Congestive heart failure</a><br> Cardiac insufficiency is a condition in which the heart for some reason loses the ability to provide the body with the necessary amount of blood. Unfortunately, this disease is quite common, especially among the elderly and is more common in women.<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/diagnosis-of-angina.html" title="Diagnosis of angina">Diagnosis of angina</a><br> Angina is translated from Latin means "angina pectoris". This disease, which is the main manifestation of the painful attack of the sternum, at least - in the heart.<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/diagnosis-of-hypertension.html" title="Diagnosis of hypertension">Diagnosis of hypertension</a><br> Hypertension - is to increase the hydrostatic pressure of the blood, which is observed in the arteries of the systemic circulation. Normally, the figures may also be pressure to fluctuate. For example, it increases during exercise or emotional arousal and decreases during sleep. However, in the normal state, it should range from 100/60 to 140/90.<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/endocarditis.html" title="Endocarditis">Endocarditis</a><br> Endocarditis, an inflammatory disease of the inner lining of the heart may be one of the manifestations of rheumatic fever, and there may be a distinct disease of an infectious nature. Now we look at the reasons and the main symptoms of infective endocarditis (IE), as well as methods of diagnosis and treatment.<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/heart-disease.html" title="Heart Disease">Heart Disease</a><br> According to the statistics of deaths from diseases of the cardiovascular system in the world is growing all the time. The study of the causes of these diseases has shown that some of them are associated with infection, others have a hereditary or congenital in nature. However, the largest group of diseases is largely the consequences of bad habits and poor lifestyle. Such diseases to some extent can be prevented.<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/hypertension.html" title="Hypertension">Hypertension</a><br> Hypertension - the most common chronic disease in adults associated with increased blood pressure. The sooner you have identified hypertension and started watching her in the dynamics, the lower the risk of developing complications of hypertension in the future.<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/mitral-valve-prolapse.html" title="Mitral valve prolapse">Mitral valve prolapse</a><br> Mitral Valve Prolapse - a heart disease, in which the deflection mitral valve into the left atrium during left ventricle contraction. In most cases, the disease is asymptomatic and detected incidentally during prophylactic examination. The methods of diagnosis include electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiogram of the heart (echocardiogram).<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/myocardial-infarction.html" title="Myocardial infarction">Myocardial infarction</a><br> The oxygen and nutrients to the cells of the heart muscle delivers a special extensive network of blood vessels, called coronary. Myocardial infarction is one of the occlusion thrombus such receptacles (95% of the thrombus formed in the coronary arteries of atherosclerotic plaques). After 40 minutes, the process begins irreversible changes in the cells and to the third-sixth hour from the start of the occlusion of the heart muscle dies at this site. The clinical picture of myocardial infarction is diverse, which makes the correct diagnosis as soon as possible.<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/rheumatic-fever.html" title="Rheumatic fever">Acute rheumatic fever</a><br> Acute rheumatic fever - a serious late complication of angina (acute tonsillitis). Usually rheumatism sick children between the ages of 5 and 15 years, although they may fall ill adults. The first symptoms of rheumatic fever usually appear after 1-5 weeks after a sore throat.<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/treatment-of-angina-pectoris.html" title="Treatment of angina pectoris">Treatment of angina pectoris</a><br> Angina - a disease whose main symptom is an attack of chest pain. Typically, the pain occur after physical exertion, stress, against the background of emotional arousal, and even as a result of a large meal. Diagnosis is based on the patient's full and comprehensive examination of the cardiovascular system. Once the diagnosis of "angina" is set, the doctor selects the appropriate treatment.<br><br>
<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/treatment-of-hypertension.html" title="Treatment of hypertension">Treatment of hypertension</a><br> Hypertension - this increase in blood pressure in the arteries of the systemic circulation. The pressure fluctuations are possible in normal (it is reduced during sleep and increases in physical activity and psycho-emotional excitation).
