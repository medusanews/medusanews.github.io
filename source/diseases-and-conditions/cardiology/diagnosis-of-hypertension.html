Hypertension - is to increase the hydrostatic pressure of the blood, which is observed in the arteries of the systemic circulation. Normally, the figures may also be pressure to fluctuate. For example, it increases during exercise or emotional arousal and decreases during sleep. However, in the normal state, it should range from 100/60 to 140/90.<br><br> The regular increase in pressure above these figures indicates the development of hypertension.<br> The people increased pressure often called <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/hypertension.html" title="Hypertension">hypertension</a> or hypertension, but according to the WHO is currently in medicine, the term hypertension.<br><br> There are two types of the disease:<br><br> 1. Essential or primary hypertension accounts for the lion's share of all suffering from the disease, in this case, hypertension is a distinct disease.<br><br> 2. Symptomatic or secondary develops as a result of the defeat of the endocrine system, kidney and other organs, that is the root cause of increasing the pressure to be found in other disease, hypertension, only a consequence or symptom of defeat of a body.<br><br> Diagnosis of hypertension is based on three studies: blood pressure measurement, clinical examination and electrocardiogram.
<h2>Measurement of blood pressure</h2>
Measurement of blood pressure is carried out using a tonometer. They are mechanical and electronic. Electronic versions are convenient and easy to use, to the same pulse count.<br><br> As mentioned earlier, blood pressure varies depending on the age, condition of the heart, physical activity, emotional conditions and even drugs which receives people. That is why the single pressure rise, of course, is not a sign of hypertension. To confirm the diagnosis requires regular measurement of the parameters of pressure, and on both hands.<br><br> The clinical examination consists of finding complaints, assessing risk factors (diabetes, smoking, atherosclerosis, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="Obesity">obesity</a>, etc.). It is also necessary attention is paid to family history, the doctor finds out if there is a family of relatives suffering from hypertension. Carried out auscultation, that is listening heart sounds with stethoscope. A doctor can detect noises that indicate defects or changes in the heart. These data in turn indirectly confirm the existence of hypertension.
<h2>Electrocardiogram</h2>
Electrocardiogram can detect heart rhythm abnormalities and diagnose the increase of the left ventricle, which is characteristic of hypertension.<br> Additional research is primarily concerned Doppler. This <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/ultrasound-examination.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> blood flow in the veins and arteries. When hypertension is primarily examined the carotid arteries and blood vessels of the brain.<br><br> Of course, you can not do without the blood chemistry. It is necessary to clarify the level of cholesterol and lipoproteins. After all, these materials are the basis of atherosclerosis, which in turn serves as a fertile ground for the development of hypertension.<br><br> If it is suspected that hypertension is symptomatic, they begin to look for the cause of development. This primarily examined kidney. Appointed by urinalysis, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/blood-test-total.html" title="Blood test (total)">blood test</a> for creatinine and urea, renal ultrasound and blood vessels.<br><br> If the suspicions fall on the endocrine system, the conduct of its comprehensive survey, which is based on a blood test for a variety of hormones and glands ultrasound.<br><br> Hypertension is a serious disease that requires a professional approach and comprehensive treatment.<br><br> It is therefore recommended that you consult a qualified doctor as soon as you commit some time in their high blood pressure.
