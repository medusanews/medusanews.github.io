<h2>General</h2>
Arrhythmias - a group of common diseases of the cardiovascular system, characterized by a change in the frequency or regularity of heartbeats. Arrhythmias are divided into tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), bradycardia (slow heart rate), arrythmia (sudden contraction) and heart block (in case of blockade of impulse can not pass through certain areas of the heart muscle and reducing the different chambers of the heart do not take place in a coordinated).
<h2>Causes arrhythmia</h2>
The heart is one of the most amazing organ in our body. It has the property of automaticity - the ability to contract rhythmically under the influence of impulses emerging in him. This means that the heart can be relatively autonomous and provide the body with blood, even in cases of possible damage to the nervous system. However, under the influence of various factors, even in this almost perfect system errors may occur and interruptions. At the heart arrhythmia on the change in the conditions of formation of the excitation of the heart muscle or anomaly and its pathways.<br><br> Arrhythmias may be caused by functional impairment and severe organic lesions of the heart.
<h2>The symptoms of arrhythmia</h2>
- Palpitations;<br> - Weakness, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/dizziness.html">dizziness</a>;<br> - Pain or pressure in the chest;<br> - Shortness of breath or rapid breathing;<br> - Fainting and loss of consciousness.<br><br> Patients often long period of time without experiencing any discomfort associated with the disease and later to seek treatment.
<h2>What you can do?</h2>
Arrhythmia to qualified cardiologist. If you or your loved ones is a suspicion of arrhythmia, should immediately consult a specialist. Do not self-medicate. It is important to remember that antiarrhythmic drugs may appoint a doctor, since almost all drugs have the so called pro-arrhythmic activity. That is, the drug itself can cause attacks of arrhythmia, even those who before the patient was not.
<h2>What can the doctor?</h2>
The doctor may suspect an arrhythmia already on auscultation of the heart. In this case, the patient is prescribed ECG study. An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) - a graphical representation of the potential differences arising during the operation of the heart on the surface of the body, registered under the name of the electrocardiograph machine in electrocardiography. Is one of the main methods of diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.<br><br> In order to study the dynamics of the patient developed a special method by which the daily ECG - Holter monitoring. ECG recording is conducted continuously for 24 hours. It uses a small wearable recorder, which produces-hour ECG recording and transmitting information about the work of the heart for a day in your computer. It is also possible holding exercise ECG: patient during the study offer a pedal ergometer or run the moving walkway.<br><br> In order to identify the cause of the arrhythmia, you may be assigned additional research methods.<br><br> As a rule, for the treatment of arrhythmias is prescribed antiarrhythmic drugs. In some cases, this can significantly reduce the manifestations of arrhythmia. In severe cases, you may need to install a pacemaker (a device designed to maintain the rhythm of the heart).
<h2>Prevention of arrhythmia</h2>
Prevention is to control arrhythmias and early treatment of chronic diseases of the cardiovascular system, as well as regular health examinations with the passage of ECG study.
