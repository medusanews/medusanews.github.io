<h2>Overview</h2>

Hyperventilation- a phenomenon that occurs with frequent shallow breathing, if breathing is produced in the upper chest. This leads to the fact that carbon dioxide levels in the blood decreases. That reduction of carbon dioxide leads to the fact that hemoglobin does not give oxygen and the body is suffering from hypoxia. The arteries are reduced, it reduces blood volume, distilled through the body. In this case, our brains and bodies are short of oxygen.

<h2>Causes of Hyperventilation</h2>

A similar condition can occur when a very strong anxiety, fear or wanton bursts of emotion. Many other conditions can also cause hyperventilation syndrome - an attack of panic disorder, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a>, hysteria, heart disease, such as <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/congestive-heart-failure.html" title="Congestive heart failure">congestive heart failure</a> or heart attack, acute pain, drugs that cause <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">bleeding</a> (eg, an overdose of aspirin), pregnant ketoacidosis and similar medical conditions , the use of stimulants, lung disease (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/vascular-disease/pulmonary-embolism.html">pulmonary embolism</a> /blood clots in the vessels of the lungs/), infectious diseases (such as <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/pneumonia.html">pneumonia</a> or <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/sepsis.html">sepsis</a>).

<h2>Symptoms of hyperventilation</h2>

If you experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical attention: fast breathing, shortness of breath, oppressive feeling of tightness, chest pain, anxiety, dry mouth, blurred vision, tingling in fingers and toes, pain and cramps in the hands and fingers, loss of consciousness.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

During the attack to slow the rate of respiration. Take a breath in 10 seconds. Do not breathe into a paper bag. This is dangerous because you may not have enough oxygen.<br>
You may need the help of outsiders to cope with stress and anxiety, which became the cause of hyperventilation. Seek help from relatives, friends, spiritual advisor, a doctor or specialist mental health center. You should always consult a doctor.

When you have a hyperventilation, the doctor will be able to know how you feel and watch your breath, identifying which muscles of the chest and adjacent areas of work you are in the process of respiration.<br><br>

Among other things, your doctor may conduct the following investigations: ECG / chest radiograph, blood for oxygen, carbon dioxide, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/computed-tomography.html" title="Computed tomography">computed tomography</a> of the chest, the study of ventilation / blood supply to the lungs.
