<h2>Symptoms</h2>

Pulmonary tuberculosis may be asymptomatic for a long time or a chance to show up and malosimptomno during fluoroscopy, chest x-ray, Mantoux test formulation. Often the symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis is difficult to distinguish from the symptoms of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/bronchitis.html">bronchitis</a>, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/pneumonia.html">pneumonia</a> or SARS.

Mantoux test is conducted annually for all children in the absence of contraindications. In the event of a positive reaction or hyperergic pediatrician may refer the child to the TB clinic for further examination. However, it should be understood that such a positive reaction may be a manifestation of both infectious <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/allergology/allergy.html" title="Allergy">Allergy</a> and postvaccinal. In evaluating the results of n rinimayut into account the period elapsed since vaccination or revaccination, the nature and dynamics of the previous reactions. There are strict criteria on which the doctor can distinguish between primary infection of postvaccinal allergy. If you suspect an infection with Mycobacterium prescribed additional examination, which is generally similar to the survey of adults:

- The holding bsledovanie sputum microscopy and bacteriology;
- Radiography of the lungs;
- Complete blood count (may be revealed mild increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocytosis with a small shift to the left leukocyte counts, eosinophilia, lymphopenia).

If necessary, designate a <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/computed-tomography.html" title="Computed tomography">CT</a> scan or <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/magnetic-resonance-imaging.html" title="Magnetic Resonance Imaging">MRI</a> of the lung, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/bronchoscopy.html" title="Bronchoscopy">bronchoscopy</a>, lung biopsy, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/x-rays.html" title="X-rays">X-ray</a> of spine, joints, abdominal <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/ultrasound-examination.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> and other tests.

If the diagnosis indicates the localization of lesions, the phase of the pathological process, and complications. Presence or absence of patient selection tubercle bacillus tuberculosis is characterized as BK (+) or BC (-). BK + patients are active and smear-able to infect the people around them airborne.

The mainstay of treatment is a causal chemotherapy. Treatment of TB patients long-term (6-18 months) and includes several stages (hospital-sanatorium tuberculosis dispensary).

Begin chemotherapy immediately after diagnosis, a long-term and continuous. Usually prescribed combination of two or more drugs (this includes drugs such as isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, streptomycin, pyrazinamide, and others). Also spend a set of non-specific measures aimed at strengthening the body's defenses (clinical nutrition, vitamin therapy, physiotherapy, exercise therapy, etc.).
