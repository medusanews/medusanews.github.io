<h2>Overview</h2>

Pneumonia - an infection of the lungs. It usually affects children under two years old, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems (such as diabetes, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/aids.html">AIDS</a>, alcoholics). There are many types of pneumonia, which vary in severity from mild to severe and sometimes fatal.

<h2>Causes of pneumonia</h2>

Often the cause is bacterial flora, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bacterial pneumonia can develop after upper respiratory tract infections such as <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/colds.html">colds</a> or flu. Approximately 50% of cases the causative agent of pneumonia is the virus. Viral pneumonia is more common in winter and is usually not as sharp as the nature of bacterial pneumonia.<br><br>

In some cases, is caused by mycoplasma - organisms with properties of both viruses and bacteria.<br><br>

Other pathogens of pneumonia may be fungi and parasites, but it happens much less often.

<h2>Symptoms of pneumonia</h2>

Symptoms of pneumonia can be similar to the symptoms of colds or flu. Depending on the etiology of pneumonia may have different symptoms.<br><br>

Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia can occur as acute or gradual.<br>
They include: <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/fever.html">fever</a>, shivering, severe <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/pain-in-the-chest.html">pain in the chest</a>, profuse sweating, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/cough.html">cough</a> with thick, reddish or greenish sputum, rapid pulse and rapid breathing, cyanotic lips and nails.<br><br>

For viral pneumonia characterized by fever, dry cough, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headache</a>, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue and severe shortness of breath.<br><br>

Symptoms of pneumonia caused by mycoplasma, often similar to the symptoms of bacterial and viral pneumonia, but is usually less pronounced.

<h2>Complications of pneumonia</h2>

- Inflammation of the pleura (pleurisy);<br>
- Pulmonary edema;<br>
- Lung abscess (in the lung cavity filled with pus);<br>
- Respiratory disorders.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

Consult a physician immediately. Before this can take a febrifuge, suitable drugs against cough.<br><br>

Seek emergency medical attention or call him at home in the following cases:<br><br>

- Cough, chest pain, fever;<br>
- A sharp deterioration in general condition after a cold or flu;<br>
- Chills, shortness of breath.<br><br>

If pneumonia is suspected in persons over 65 years, people with chronic illnesses or weakened immune systems, children and pregnant women should immediately call a doctor, who is likely to prompt hospitalization.

<h2>What can your doctor?</h2>

To confirm the diagnosis of chest radiography performed. Causative agent was determined by a special analysis of blood and sputum. In identifying bacterial or fungal infections, and antibiotic therapy is prescribed antifungal drugs.<br><br>

In severe cases the patient sent to hospital. In severe respiratory failure carried oxygen therapy.

<h2>Prophylaxis</h2>

- People over 65 and other risk groups recommended vaccinations against certain types of strep (he is one of the most common pathogens);<br>
- For children at-risk groups (eg, asthma patients), a special vaccine;<br>
- Because pneumonia often occurs as a complication of influenza, annual vaccination against influenza is also a way to prevent;<br>
- How can you wash your hands frequently with soap, for 15-30 seconds to remove germs that can cause pneumonia;<br>
- Maintain the body's resistance with a healthy diet, rest and regular exercise;<br>
- Do not smoke. Smoking reduces the natural resistance of bronchi and lungs to respiratory infections.<br><br>

Call an ambulance if your eyes on the man began to choke, he turned blue nails and nasolabial triangle, heard a heavy, raspy breathing, difficulty swallowing.
