Thanks to the precious strands can get rid of small wrinkles, increase skin elasticity, refresh the complexion, reduce stretch marks, prevent the appearance of cellulite. However, this method is extremely effective for women who have only appeared the first signs of aging. As a preventive measure to prevent wrinkles and cellulite implantation of threads is recommended as early as 25-30 years.<br><br> Patients older than 50 implanted gold thread, unfortunately, useless.<br><br> The method of reinforcement is to be implanted under the skin with gold threads, combined with the strength of polyglycol threads, which are then absorbed.<br><br> Before the surgery, the doctor will determine an individual picture lines through which the reinforcement. Then, using a needle with a three-sided sharpened tip (for less traumatic penetration) are introduced under the skin of the finest gold wire with a diameter of only 0.1 mm. Sew them at a depth of 3 mm, which prevents damage to major blood vessels and nerve endings. The threads are implanted in the direction of wrinkles and under them (for their anti-aliasing) or applied as a grid (for the correction of vast areas with fine wrinkles or sagging skin).<br><br> Implantation procedure lasts about 40-45 minutes and is performed under local anesthesia.

The result is stored from 5 to 10 years (depending on the patient's age, health condition, and skin elasticity). Over time, the active growth of new cells is stopped and the procedure must be repeated.<br><br> In addition to gold is also used for the reinforcement of platinum - both biologically inert metal, do not cause allergies and are not oxidized.<br><br> Come up with the Egyptians<br><br> The idea of this method is not new: thus retain youth and beauty of Cleopatra and Nefertiti. Archaeologists found gold wires inside the remains of other great ladies who were buried in the Egyptian pyramids. The rebirth of this technology was a few decades ago in France.
