<h2>The reasons for discolored teeth</h2>

Changes in the color of the teeth are divided into superficial and deep. Surface staining occurs by eating foods that have strong coloring properties, such as coffee, tea, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, soy sauce, tomatoes, mustard, chocolate, blueberries, red wine, as well as under the influence of nicotine. Deep staining of hard tissues of teeth is influenced by a number of drugs and other chemicals. An example is the dark-gray staining of teeth in children due to the use of tetracycline antibiotics by the mother during <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a>, or until the child reaches the age of eight (i.e., throughout the period of bookmarks and tooth formation). Deep staining observed by eating water with high content of iron and fluoride, as well as a number of systemic diseases.

<h2>Methods of teeth whitening</h2>

Modern methods of teeth whitening can be divided into two groups: bleaching in a dental office and home bleaching. As a bleaching agent used three groups of substances: hydrogen peroxide, chloride and chlorine. The highest intensity of the bleaching reaction is observed when using hydrogen peroxide, which is most often used for this purpose. Bleaching occurs due to the oxidation reaction.<br><br>

The techniques used in the dental office, are large concentrations of active ingredients, which makes it possible to accelerate the whitening process. It should be remembered that after the procedure, should refrain from smoking and drinking tea, coffee, red wine and other products, coloring the teeth, in two days.<br><br>

Whitening at home involves the use of whitening gel and the average concentration of individual matrix made of a plaster model of the patient's dentition. As the concentration of a chemical agent for home bleaching is much lower than its concentration in the bleaching dentist's office, the time required to achieve comparable results, is greatly increased. Usually, the end result is achieved after about 2-6 weeks and depends on several factors: the time of application to the teeth whitening agent, on its concentration and, of course, from the initial extent and nature of the darkening of the teeth.<br><br>

A separate group consists of whitening toothpastes, mouthwashes for mouth and gum bleaching. By using this group of drugs whitening effect is achieved mainly due to the mechanical cleaning of the tooth surface from plaque and dyes.

<h2>Complications</h2>

Professional teeth whitening in compliance with all rules and contraindications is quite innocuous procedure. During treatment, there may be some increase in tooth sensitivity and irritation of the soft tissues of the mouth. This discomfort usually last from one to four days and go with the cessation of bleaching.<br><br>

It is much more dangerous can be all sorts of uncontrolled use of bleaching systems at home. At best, the result will be a lack of desired effect, and in the worst diseases of the teeth and oral cavity.
