<h2>General</h2>
Cervix - the lower part of the uterus is that it connects the body with the vagina. Cervical canal is lined with a cylindrical glandular epithelium, which is called endocervical. Cervical polyp is a local tissue growth cervical canal. It is believed that the disease is associated with hormonal disorders and inflammatory diseases of the female genital organs. Polyps are mostly benign.<br><br> Malignization polyps of the mucous membrane of the cervical canal is very rare, but this possibility can not be excluded.<br><br> This is why the diagnosis of cervical polyp is a strong indication for surgical removal and histological study. Most often this disease is common in women after 40 years.
<h2>Causes of the disease</h2>
- Chronic inflammatory diseases of the female genital organs<br> - Changes in the endocrine regulation of reproductive function (hormonal changes)<br> - Result of trauma of the cervix.
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Polyp of the cervix can occur completely asymptomatic. Often the diagnosis is made by routine inspection at the gynecologist.<br><br> Possible symptoms may include:<br><br> - <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/bleeding.html">Bleeding</a> during or after sexual intercourse (polyp mechanically injured during sexual intercourse)<br><br> - Pre-and post-menstrual bleeding from the vagina<br><br> - Heavy menstrual bleeding<br><br> - Copious mucous discharge from the vagina.<br> Furthermore, the presence of cervical polyp, and the body of the uterus may cause <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/infertility.html" title="Infertility">infertility</a>. Polyp in this case prevents the implantation of the ovum.
<h2>Diagnostics</h2>
If you notice at the above symptoms, try as soon as possible to see a gynecologist. Cervical polyps are detected by a standard gynecological examination. In some cases, you may need a colposcopy (examination of the mucous membrane of the cervix and vagina using a special endoscope). After the diagnosis and removal of polyps without fail produce histological examination of the mucous membrane of the cervix and of the polyp.
<h2>Treatment</h2>
Treatment involves excision of a polyp histological examination of tissue removed. In most cases, in addition to removing the polyp carried scraping the mucosa cervix and uterus. The need for scraping due to the fact that polyps often develop against endometrial hyperplastic processes and endocervical.<br><br> Further treatment strategy depends on the results of histological examination. Upon detection of dysplasia or <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancer</a>, the patient will be sent to the oncologist. Benign polyps require further observation, correction of hormonal levels and early detection and treatment of inflammatory diseases..
