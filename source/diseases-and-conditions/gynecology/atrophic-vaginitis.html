<h2>General</h2>

This disease has a close relationship with a deficit of sex hormones (estrogen) in women that occurs after menopause. 7-10 years after the cessation of menstruation vaginitis occurs in nearly half of the women and 10 years later, and its frequency increases to 73-75%.<br> There are two forms of atrophic vaginitis: postmenopausal women and is associated with artificial menopause.
<h2>Causes of the disease</h2>
Under physiological conditions, estrogens promote the proliferation of the vaginal epithelium and the improvement of its blood supply. The normal level of estrogen provides the formation of lactic acid and maintaining acidic vaginal contents, which creates favorable conditions for the reproduction of "useful" lactobacilli and inhibits the growth of pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms.<br><br> In postmenopausal atrophic changes occur, leading to a decrease in the lumen of the vagina, his thinning of the epithelium, vaginal smooth out wrinkles. These atrophic changes serve as the backdrop for a long chronic course of inflammatory processes (bacterial vaginitis).<br><br> Atrophic vaginitis is not sexually transmitted.
