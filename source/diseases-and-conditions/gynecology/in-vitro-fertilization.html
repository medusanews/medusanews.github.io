<h2>General</h2>
Infertility - a diagnosis that if at a regular sexual life <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> does not occur within 1 year. There are a number of reasons that can lead to infertility. You should be very clear that if one of the partners is diagnosed with <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/infertility.html" title="Infertility">infertility</a> does not mean that the couple could not have children. This means that both spouses should undergo a detailed examination and qualified treatment. According to statistics, more than 50% of diagnoses are removed as a result of treatment. For the rest, one of the treatment options that are now offering modern clinic is in vitro fertilization (IVF).<br><br> IVF - is one of the treatments for infertility, the essence of which is that the egg is fertilized and develop outside the body of the mother. In the woman's uterus is transferred embryo (fetus, consisting of only a few cells). Further stages of fetal development occurs in the uterus, in the same way as in the natural fertilization.
<h2>Indications for in vitro fertilization</h2>
1) Female infertility:<br> - Tubal pathology (abnormalities of the structure, function abnormalities as a result of the transferred inflammatory diseases of the pelvic organs, ectopic pregnancy, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/Endometriosis.html" title="Endometriosis">endometriosis</a>)<br> - Long unsuccessful treatment of endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome and other severe diseases of the female genital organs.<br> 2) Male Infertility:<br> - Complete absence or reduction in the number of sperm in the semen;<br> - Reduced sperm quality, such as their mobility.<br> The use of IVF is not only recommended for conditions that are contraindicated in pregnancy because of the impossibility of a successful general of pregnancy
<h2>IVF procedure</h2>
There are a number of protocols (schemes) treatment. Selecting a particular protocol does the doctor on the basis of the medical history of patients and the results of a detailed survey. The main difference consists in the application protocols of various drugs and duration of therapy.
<h3>The main stages of the standard in vitro fertilization procedure</h3>
1) Stimulation of superovulation and monitoring of the development of follicles using ultrasound. The objective of phase preparation of a large number of mature oocytes to increase the chance of pregnancy.<br><br> 2) Follicle puncture and eggs. Follicle puncture is performed under intravenous anesthesia and <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/ultrasound-examination.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> guidance. Male patient in this day delivers sperm, which is subject to special treatment before insemination or fertilization of eggs.<br><br> 3) As artificial insemination. Conducted by medical embryology in the embryology laboratory. Fertilization is carried out in one of two ways: insemination in vitro, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). At first, a simple way to the eggs, which are a medium, a suspension of sperm. Within 2-3 hours of one sperm penetrates the egg and fertilizes it. In the second method, sperm injected into the egg "by hand" using microsurgical instruments. After penetration of the sperm egg is an embryo. Embryos contained in vitro from 2 to 5 days. With the help of modern genetic technologies can be examined embryo for possible genetic disorders, as well as to determine the sex of the baby.<br><br> 4) The transfer of embryos. Embryo transfer is a special catheter through the cervix on the 2nd day 5 after follicular puncture. Usually 3 embryos are transferred, with the remaining exposed cryofreeze embryos may be used in the subsequent IVF.<br><br> 5) Support the luteal phase. To reduce the risk of spontaneous <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> after embryo transfer for 2 weeks prescribers progesterone.<br> After 2 weeks, a woman gives blood to confirm or rule out pregnancy. Depending on the outcome of the research is defined further tactics of the patient.
<h2>Complications after IVF</h2>
The main possible complication of IVF is ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome complex pathological symptoms that may occur during treatment with stimulants ovulation.
<h2>Pregnancy and childbirth</h2>
If successful, the further course of pregnancy and <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/childbirth.html" title="Childbirth">childbirth</a> are no different from pregnancy during natural fertilization. According to experts, children conceived through in vitro fertilization, are no different from the rest. Is that love and care goes into them several times.
