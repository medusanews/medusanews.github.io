<h2>General</h2>
Childbirth - a physiological process of exile and formed mature fetus from the uterus to the outside. By the time of onset of labor share on timely deliveries, premature and delayed. Term labor is a labor of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a> from 38 to 42 weeks. Like all physiological processes, childbirth largely occur instinctively and managed by hormonal and neurological level. However, expect to see the "little miracle" without applying effort is not worth it.<br><br> Pregnancy and childbirth is a laborious task that can be done only by the woman. While obstetricians, gynecologists and pediatricians provide maternal and child health and will help in emergency situations.
<h2>Mental attitude</h2>
The proper attitude for childbirth and self-confidence woman should cultivate throughout the pregnancy. This will greatly help you Classes for expectant mothers, as well as reading additional literature. From the outset, you need to set yourself that giving birth - it's not scary.<br><br> Do not convince yourself that the birth process is painless. This is not the case and everyone knows it. Try to think about what will happen after you see your baby will be able to kiss and hug him. Collect all the power and will in a fist and try to give birth to her child so that he was as light as possible to experience this serious moment of transition.<br><br> In fact, the process of giving birth to a child is much more difficult and dangerous. Imagine this: living baby inside your warm and soft body, getting ready to split the nutrients and oxygen through the placenta directly into the blood, and only sometimes slightly moving his pen or a leg, but now he needs for some 5-10 hours by unusual movements and efforts to be born , begin to breathe, cry, see, hear, eat and drink... Try to help, not hinder it!
<h2>Natural childbirth or caesarean section?</h2>
Childbirth is divided into spontaneous, that is, through the birth canal, and operational - Cesarean section. Cesarean delivery may be scheduled, ie date of birth in this case is determined in advance and emergency when the indications for cesarean section occur suddenly. Caesarean section is a surgical procedure in which the fetus is removed through an incision in the abdominal wall and uterus.<br><br> The risk to life and health of women during cesarean section is many times higher than in spontaneous labor. Therefore, like any other surgery, caesarean section is performed strictly according to testimony, when spontaneous delivery is not possible or contraindicated. Therefore, the motivation of "I do not want to give birth, it hurts, it is better to figure spoil Caesarean section" is fundamentally false. And for the fetus and the pregnant woman for birth vaginally are the most healthy and natural.
<h2>Where to give birth?</h2>
"Where to give birth?" - This is the next big question that must be addressed before the birth the woman.<br><br> The most common and safest option is to give birth in hospital, ie in the nursing home. It will be carried out constant and continuous monitoring of the state of women in labor and basic vital functions of the fetus. In the hospital at birth there is a pediatrician who evaluates the condition of the child immediately after birth and helps in case of deviations. We must not forget also about the possibility of unforeseen complications in labor, which usually occur suddenly and require immediate medical help.<br><br> When selecting a maternity hospital should be specified for the following services: anesthesia department, the department of children's intensive care unit (even in normal childbirth occurring immediately after birth the child may need intensive therapy), Department of Blood Transfusion. Have a look at the statistics: the number of births per year, maternal and perinatal mortality. Of great importance is the comfort of stay in the hospital: attentive staff, comfortable house, the possibility of family visits, etc.<br><br> Home births attract people that a woman in labor is in a familiar environment, feel more at ease and confident. However, a statistically proven that the number of complications and poor outcomes such clans in times greater than landlines. This is due to the lack of dynamic monitor monitoring pregnant woman and the fetus and the extremely low-skilled personnel (compare midwife or doctor who performed 20 deliveries every day in the hospital with those who are 1-2 births per month from home).<br> However, if you decided to give birth at home, it should be possible to transport to the nearest hospital or maternity home in case complications arise. Otherwise, you risk not only their lives but also the lives of their children.<br><br> Deliveries usually taken on a special bed in the position of a woman on her back with legs bent and feet spread apart. In the Middle East, India, women often give birth squatting or on special beds that provide a vertical position. In our country the vertical birth also gained popularity in the modern maternity hospitals there is a possibility of delivery management in an upright position. Talk to your obstetrician will be right for such an option for you.<br> Births in water have also become popular in our country. This reduces the duration of the first stage of labor, and achieve a high analgesic effect. For delivery in water using a special pool. It should be understood that the process of birth of the child is not in the water, and on the chair. After all, people - overland and animal nature has, that the child should not be born into the aquatic environment.
<h2>Pain in childbirth</h2>
Deliveries are accompanied by sensations of pain of varying severity. Every woman perceives the pain in different ways, depending on the mental attitude of childbirth and pain threshold.<br><br> In some instances, may require anesthesia maternity. At the expense of analgesia in humans, there are two common misconceptions: it is dangerous for the child birth should be natural to me to be hurt.<br><br> In fact, the woman in labor is sometimes unprepared for the pain that accompanies childbirth. The problem is in the fact that the body can react to such a radical uncomfortable birth: for example, stopping the generic activities. Pain relief in such a situation not only helps the expectant mother, but also contributes to the smooth progress of the fetus through the birth canal. All the more so now in the possession of Anesthesiologists is not one but many safe options for removing labor pain. It can be various sedatives, analgesics or epidural anesthesia. Drugs used for pain relief in labor, do not oppress the generic activities and do not adversely affect the baby.<br> Stipulate anesthesia options with your doctor beforehand. Of course, without your permission you will not be any manipulation, including pain management. Only in exceptional cases, if the patient's life or her child in danger, the doctor has the right to decide on urgent basis of a procedure or surgery.
<h2>The process of giving birth</h2>
Genera consist of three periods: The first stage of labor during labor, in which the cervix of the uterus. The second stage of labor during exile or bearing-down period, during which the child is born. The third period during the delivery of the placenta. Contractions - is regular uterine contractions, accompanied by a dragging <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/abdominal-pain.html">pain in the abdomen</a> and (or) in the lower back. Initially contractions are weak, lasting a few seconds, and the gap between them is 10-12 minutes. Sometimes contractions begin immediately after every 5-6 minutes, but not very strong. Gradually the contractions become more frequent, severe, prolonged, painful. Usually nulliparous bout last 10-12 hours, multifarious 6-8 hours.<br><br> Sometimes labor begins with the rupture of membranes. In such a case, you should immediately go to the hospital.<br><br> Once you get into the maternity hospital, observe all instructions of the medical staff. Rely on doctors.
