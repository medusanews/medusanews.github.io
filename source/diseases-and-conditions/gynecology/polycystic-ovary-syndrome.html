<h2>General</h2>
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), also known as Stein-Leventhal syndrome or sclerocysticum is an endocrine (hormonal) disorder in which the ovaries are enlarged and contain many small vesicles filled with fluid. PCOS - a fairly common disease. Polycystic occurs when the ovaries to produce excess male hormones (androgens), which are normally produced in very small quantities.<br><br> During each menstrual cycle in the ovaries formed a number of small follicles (bubbles) of which may subsequently come out the egg. Normally, in the middle of the menstrual cycle, during ovulation (rupture of the follicle), one egg leaves one of the follicles (any ovary), and the other follicles become overripe and stop working. With PCOS, the egg is not matured and ovulation does not occur. Follicles are not broken, and filled with a liquid and turn into cysts. Accordingly, the ovaries may increase in size, becoming more normal by 2-5 times.<br> Women with polycystic ovary syndrome, often manifested masculine traits such as excessive hair growth on the face and body, acne, baldness and occipital abdominal fat (fat is stored around the waist).<br><br> According to doctors it affects about 5-10% of all women who have not yet gone through <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/menopause.html" title="Menopause">menopause</a>. This is one of the main causes of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/infertility.html" title="Infertility">infertility</a>, moreover, many women do not know they have.
<h2>Reasons</h2>
There is no consensus among doctors still do not. However it is known that the disease associated with tissue insensitivity to insulin (hormone involved in the regulation of blood sugar levels). Recent studies suggest that the ovaries of women suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome, in excess produce male sex hormones, because the body can not properly process the insulin. The level of insulin in the blood is so high that the ovaries react to it excessive production of male sex hormones.
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Symptoms may occur at any age. May develop during puberty, and then the menstrual period may be delayed or never arrive. Girls are overweight and have a hair growth in male pattern, for example, chest and face.

About 20% of women (not yet passed through the menopause), with no symptoms of polycystic as such by <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/ultrasound-examination.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> detected polycystic ovaries.
<h2>Complications</h2>
Stein-Leventhal syndrome may increase the likelihood of developing certain diseases. Therefore, it is important to have regular medical checkups. Even if some of the symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome partly disappear after menopause, a certain time may occur various diseases.<br><br> Type 2 diabetes. By the time they reach menopause around 50% of women with sclerocysticum diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it is important to maintain the right to pre-launch lifestyle and follow a healthy diet.<br><br> Elevated cholesterol. Elevated levels of testosterone can cause high levels of LDL (the "bad" form of cholesterol) in your body, which eventually leads to an increased risk of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/heart-disease.html" title="Heart Disease">heart disease</a> and heart attacks.<br><br> <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/endometrial-cancer.html">Endometrial cancer</a>. Because women with PCOS do not ovulate often, they have periods during which the endometrium is too built up. This may increase the risk of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/cancer-malignant-neoplasms.html">cancer</a> of the uterus, although precise data on this phenomenon yet.

You can write a progestogen (a synthetic analogue of the female sex hormone progesterone) or contraceptives to induce regular menstrual cycles.<br><br> Some contraceptives with low concentration of active ingredients, commonly available contain a small amount of an estrogen and an anti-androgen (a substance that blocks the effects of male sex hormones) cyproterone acetate. This helps to effectively control excessive hair growth and acne. Cyproterone acetate is available in and of itself, and your doctor may advise you to this or any other anti-androgen, spironolactone, acting in a similar way.
