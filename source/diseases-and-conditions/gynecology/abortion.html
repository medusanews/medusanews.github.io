Under general anesthesia, expand the cervical canal and scrape its cavity surgically sharp instrument - a curette. Thus simultaneously removed alive, safely developing fetus and fetal membranes.
<h2>What is dangerous?</h2>
After an abortion, a very high percentage of possible surgical trauma. Each surgeon-gynecologist, even virtuoso, at least once in the course of the operation occurred rupture (perforation) of the uterus, especially if a woman has an abortion is not the first. Tools acute uterine tissue thinned and can break, despite the highly qualified surgeon. Result - abdominal surgery with suturing or <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/removal-of-the-uterus.html" title="Removal of the uterus">removal of the uterus</a>. Although such abortion complications are rare, guarantees that they elude you, no one can give.<br><br> Extremely high percentage of inflammatory complications after Using the Fn. If the inflammation becomes chronic, the uterus may eventually form adhesions and scarring - senehii. The consequences - many female ailments and <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/infertility.html" title="Infertility">infertility</a>.<br><br> As the pregnancy is interrupted for a longer period, a high percentage of hormonal complications: from the cycle disturbances to infertility. Especially if the first pregnancy. After her break chances of successfully give birth to a decline of about half, every other lady need gynecological care to get pregnant, and 80% of the pregnancies will occur.<br><br> "STRAY" TIME<br><br> According to the statistics, most of all unplanned pregnancies happen:<br><br> Under the age of 17 years<br> At the age of 40 years<br> After the birth of 4 or more children<br> In the range of less than 2 years after a previous pregnancy.
<h2>What is important to know?</h2>
The operation must be carried out only after obtaining good results smears on the flora of the vagina and blood tests and under anesthesia. In good clinics scraping performed under <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/ultrasound-examination.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> guidance. Control turnout to the doctor - a week after the first period. This condition is necessary because it allows time to identify possible complications and begin to deal with them.<br><br> Abortion complicates the course of a subsequent pregnancy in 78.3% of women and 2.5 times more likely to resort to cesarean section.
<h2>Mini-abortions</h2>
Gentle option of surgical abortion. Possible until the 21st day of a missed period, ie up to 6-7 weeks obstetric period. Performed under general or local anesthesia. This is a good choice for women who have general anesthesia is contraindicated because of heart and vascular disease, traumatic brain injury, hypersensitive.
<h3>What is happening?</h3>
Expands the cervical canal and using a vacuum aspirator sucked its contents.
<h3>What is dangerous?</h3>
Scraping sharp instrument does not occur, so the risk is much less surgical trauma. However, inflammatory and hormonal complications can occur with the same probability as in the "big" abortion. Previously, this was the most appropriate method to interrupt the first pregnancy. The priority now for the medical methods.<br><br> Abortion is 3.7 times increased risk of intrauterine growth retardation.
<h3>What is important to know?</h3>
Mini abortion should be made mandatory under ultrasound guidance. Otherwise a high risk does not completely remove the contents of the uterus, and the need to re-scraping.
<h2>Magnetic cap</h2>
It is extremely popular a few years ago, the method now lost their positions, especially in big cities. It is extremely cheap and affordable, it has a lot of "gotchas" and works only with delay menstruation no more than 7 days.
<h3>What is happening?</h3>
On the cervix recap of special material. The constant magnetic field leads to the detachment of the ovum from the uterine wall and <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/miscarriage.html" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a> for 3 days.
<h3>What is dangerous?</h3>
If you delay menstruation to 5 days with absolute accuracy is difficult to establish the fact of pregnancy: the tests were lying, then the resolution of the ultrasound is low. The cap 3 is in the vagina of the day, thus increasing the risk of inflammatory diseases. However, severe inflammation with far-reaching consequences is hardly observed. But the hormonal complications occur with the same probability as other after abortion.<br> If the method does not work, there will be only one way - scraping, and technically more complicated (the fertilized egg in the areas of hemorrhage tightly soldered to the wall of the uterus).<br><br> Newborns of mothers with a history of abortion in 3 times more often born prematurely or immature.
<h3>What is important to know?</h3>
Success depends on the qualifications of the doctor, the availability of advanced ultrasound system and the possibility of determining pregnancy by a <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/blood-test-total.html" title="Blood test (total)">blood test</a> (for specific hormones hCG and TBG). Without this, only 75% of women pregnancy can accurately determine when the delay of up to 5 days. Without accurate diagnostic method simply does not work that gives rise to the legend of his poor performance.
<h2>Medical abortion</h2>
Effective on 90-95% for up to 12 weeks, but with more than 5 weeks should be done only in a hospital. So actually performed at a delay of 14-18 days before menstruation, when it is still possible to make out-patient. Medical abortion - the safest when compared with others, but also the most expensive.
<h3>What is happening?</h3>
The active ingredient - Mifegin (mifepristone) or penkrafton. In pharmacies, these drugs do not, and in principle can not be. They have only medical institutions that have a license for this type of activity. Pregnancy terminated within 48 hours after ingestion of the tablets. Doctors recommend this method to terminate an unwanted first pregnancy.<br><br> 77% of infants born to mothers who interrupted the first pregnancy abortion, anemic and diathesis.
<h3>What is dangerous?</h3>
Inflammatory complications can not be afraid, but the possibility of incomplete abortion is still there (about 4.7%). But in this case, the possible vacuum abortion because the fertilized egg completely departs from the wall of the uterus and scraping too. The effectiveness of the method is reduced if a woman breastfeeds, has irregular menstrual cycle and / or weighing less than 50 kg. Hormonal complications is less than the vacuum abortion. The reason is clear: less gestation and therefore less <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a> hormone.
<h3>What is important to know?</h3>
At the clinic should be a good ultrasound equipment, the possibility of a blood test for pregnancy and highly qualified specialists. Within a month after the termination of pregnancy must be seen by a doctor.<br><br> ACUPUNCTURE<br><br> By the method similar to the efficiency of the magnetic cap. Because success requires specialist qualifications, what are we still have only a few, there is a method rather on the level of art, and does not apply in general practice.
