<h2>General</h2>
Atopic <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/dermatology/dermatitis.html" title="Dermatitis">dermatitis</a> (it's also called atopic dermatitis) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin allergic nature, the main symptom is severe itching. Predisposition to diffuse neurodermatitis, and other atopic diseases (bronchial asthma, pollinosis, allergic rhinitis) genetically transmitted. Therefore, usually the person who put such a diagnosis, there must exist a relative of one of the listed diseases. In most patients, the disease starts before the age of 12 years. In adulthood, atopic dermatitis manifests very rare.<br><br>
If left untreated, the disease occurs over the years, with periodic remissions and exacerbations and causes the patient to a lot of trouble.
<h2>Causes of the disease</h2>
Cause of allergic reactions in the skin of atopic dermatitis is hyperreactivity organism in response to interaction with the various substances. These materials are for the patient allergens. As an allergen can act pollen, house dust, animal dander, various food products, household chemicals, etc. Emit air, contact and food allergen in the way of penetration of the body.
<h2>The symptoms of atopic dermatitis</h2>
To atopic dermatitis characterized by recurrent exacerbations with periods that occur during the second reaction to the allergen (e.g., when used in certain food products or in contact with the animal.) The frequency of exacerbations is also influenced by the season of the year (exacerbations are more common in autumn and winter), emotional <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a> and other factors.<br><br>
The main symptom is a dry and itchy skin. Exacerbations are accompanied by widespread swelling and redness of the skin, the appearance of red spots with indistinct borders, plaques. As a result of scratching the skin appear erosion, accompanied by weeping. In the case of entry into the skin infection in places lesions appear pustules. The favorite localization of atopic dermatitis are flexor surfaces of the joints, front and side of the neck, forehead, temples, wrists, back surface of the hands and feet.
<h2>Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis</h2>
The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis puts allergist on the basis of clinical presentation and questioning of the patient. In some cases, the patient is prescribed level analysis of immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood serum. Elevated levels of this immunoglobulin says the propensity to allergic reactions of the body.<br><br>
To identify the specific allergen that causes acute disease is treated skin <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/allergology/allergy.html" title="Allergy">allergy</a> tests. During this study, the patient's skin in the forearm various allergens deposited in small doses. With a positive reaction to the place of introduction of the allergen develops redness or blister.
<h2>What you can do?</h2>
Human skin with atopic dermatitis "is always ready to" respond to the next contact allergic reaction. To prevent deterioration, avoid exposure to known allergens. Therefore, in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, an important place of adherence to prescribed diet and maintaining cleanliness in the house. In addition, it should be remembered that the constant scratching of skin allergic reaction only strengthens and promotes the adherence of infection.<br><br>
Do not let dry skin: take a bath, use soap and water as little as possible, regularly lubricate the skin with a moisturizing lotion. Avoid wearing synthetic and woolen clothes on the naked body (these materials increase the itching). You better suit loose cotton clothing and underwear.
<h2>What will the doctor</h2>
The basis of the treatment of atopic dermatitis are anti-allergic agents. Depending on the severity of these may be as an ointment for topical use containing antihistamines or corticosteroids and oral antihistamines.<br><br>
In recent years, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis also applied allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT). This method of treatment comprises administering to the patient increasing doses of the extract of the allergen to which the patient showed increased sensitivity.
