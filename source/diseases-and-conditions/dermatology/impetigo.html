More than 80% of the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is presented impetigo or beta-hemolytic streptococcus. Pathogen enters through cracks and <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/cuts-and-abrasions.html">abrasions</a> of the skin, the mouth of the hair follicle.<br><br> Impetigo can occur as a primary disease or as a complication of an existing dermatoses, such as eczema, neurodermatitis (secondary impetigo).

On the day of their contents 3-4 dries appear yellow crust, which after falling on the skin no trace.<br><br> With deep folliculitis of the skin are formed painful red nodules the size of 5 mm or more in diameter, sometimes with abscess in the middle. A few days later a knot dissolves or abscesses, and then opened. After healing of the nodule is often left rib.<br><br> With the combination of streptococcal and staphylococcal infection develops mixed (vulgar) impetigo, in which the contents of the vials is purulent, and crust - massive. Vulgar impetigo most often occurs on the face, trunk and limbs less. Eruptions are numerous. Without treatment, near the former eruptions or in remote areas of the skin there are new eruptions, the process often takes the common character.
