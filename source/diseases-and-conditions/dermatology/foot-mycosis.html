<h2>General</h2>
Before fungal foot problems were so widespread that few could avoid infection. Fortunately, from 60-70 years, drugs have become available that are truly cured patients, not just relief. But so far, athlete's foot is the most common fungal disease of the skin, followed by distribution of the following ringworm.<br><br> The most commonly affects the folds of skin between the toes and the surface of the foot (especially the soles), but in rare cases may be involved even hands. The appearance of the disease on the hands is mainly due to no direct infection and the influence of circulating in the bloodstream of toxins mushrooms. On the other hand, when combing soles microorganisms are under fingernails, where they can be transferred to other body parts, including and scalp. This simplest and most common route of infection must take into account people exposed to fungal infections. At risk are the athletes and the people who frequent swimming pools and public showers, people who do not observe the basic rules of hygiene.
<h2>Reasons</h2>
Athlete's foot are caused by several species of parasitic fungi. These microorganisms are abundant on the floor of the pools and baths and showers in a public sports complexes. The man who walks barefoot in such places, just begs to be infected.<br><br> Wearing the shoes of others and sharing towels and other hygiene products is the second common mode of transmission.<br><br> If one person suffered a fungal disease that re-infection is very easily.<br><br> The fungal growth supports the lack of proper foot care: Putting on socks and shoes on his feet wet, re-use of dirty socks, shoes insufficient ventilation between its use.
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Athlete's foot appears very flexible. The first signs of fungal disease may be cracking, painful or itchy vesicles, diaper rash, skin roughness type corns. Then, the affected skin soften, whiten and begin to flake cereal. Sometimes due to bacterial infection existing bubbles turn into ulcers or sores.<br><br> Itchy and burning sensation is almost constant symptom of athlete's foot, sometimes patients complain of pain and unpleasant foot odor.
<h2>What you can do?</h2>
If signs of fungal infection should consult a dermatologist. That doctor should prescribe treatment. We just give general advice and tips.<br><br> If you are sick, keep in mind that athlete's foot fungal infection, and fungi thrive and reproduce only in a wet environment. By eliminating moisture, you do not give these parasites multiply and spread.<br><br> Try to protect your family members from getting infected. To do this, explain to them that it is now in an apartment you can not walk barefoot, especially the bathroom. If you have the chance, do not use a bath and a shower. After taking a shower or bath necessarily treat the shower equipment, as well as the bathroom floor with disinfectant.<br><br> Every day before going to bed, wash your feet with plain soap and warm water, keep your skin at the same time not much soak and soften. Gather cloth and wipe off all the pieces have fallen away the skin, making sure that none of them got you under my nails.<br> Using the toilet paper or hair dryer, dry the feet thoroughly, especially between the toes. Then apply an antifungal cream (if the blisters burst and ooze) or ointment (if the affected area dry.) Continue treatment for four weeks, even if the symptoms disappear before.<br><br> If the skin is highly inflamed, please refrain from the use of an antifungal cream or ointment. In the morning, use powder. If antifungal powder also causes irritation, take a powder based on starch or talc. Well as daily fill this powder in shoes.<br><br> Remember, antifungal creams and ointments themselves be irritating, and can only be applied to dry skin. If your feet are prone to sweating, shoes should not be worn until the drug is not absorbed.<br><br> Wear cotton socks, preferably white, everyday wear clean. When washing socks soak in a solution of chlorine bleach (not soap) and boil for 10 minutes. This will kill the fungus on your clothes. Otherwise, the cure is almost impossible, as always there will be a re-infestation. Shoes should also be disinfected using anti-fungal sprays and then leave for a couple of days to air (preferably in the sun).<br><br> If it affects the hands, do not use anti-fungal agents, as long as you do not investigated the skin and it is diagnosed. Because if the microorganism is not there, antifungal agents are ineffective. When the disease on the soles of the feet will disappear and the display on the hands.
<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>
If necessary, your doctor may prescribe a potent and specific medication and prescription powder mixture for the preparation of disinfectant foot.<br><br> In severe cases, may be advised to use a combination therapy that also includes physiotherapy, as well as oral treatment.<br> In the event of a secondary bacterial infection (it penetrates the skin through the cracks and sores) the doctor will prescribe antibiotics for topical or systemic use.

Practice good hygiene: never go barefoot, particularly in public showers and locker rooms, daily wear fresh socks after washing and thoroughly drying the feet and between the toes, well-ventilated shoes in between using.<br><br> Be sure to take a shower before and after swimming in the pool, wear rubber slippers, as soon as you come out of the water.
