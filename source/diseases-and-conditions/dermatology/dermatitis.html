<h2>General</h2>
Dermatitis - a syndrome (set of symptoms), which is an inflammatory reaction of the skin to various stimuli.<br><br> There are contact dermatitis and drug reaction. Contact dermatitis occur when the direct effects of the stimulus on the skin, toksidermii foreign substances penetrate into the internal environment of the body, causing a series of changes, one manifestation of which is dermatitis. For example, if a reaction occurred in the skin inflammation using cream with any medicinal substance, then a contact dermatitis, and if the same material received in the body through the intestines (tablets or food), and rash occurred - a drug reaction.<br><br> In addition, to dermatitis include diseases such as seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff, acne, acne, acne), <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/dermatology/atopic-dermatitis.html" title="Atopic dermatitis">atopic dermatitis</a> (allergic) dermatitis herpetiformis, eczema, and others. In this article, we will examine a few of them.
<h2>Causes dermatitis</h2>
The stimuli that contribute to dermatitis, may have a physical, chemical or biological nature.<br><br> There are so-called obligate irritants that cause dermatitis is easy for each person. These include friction, pressure, radiation and temperature effects, acid and alkali, some plants (nettle, fraxinella, caustic buttercup, spurge). We all know what <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/burns.html">burns</a> and frostbite, blisters, every once in my life, "burned" nettles. Manifestations and severity of dermatitis are defined simply by force and duration of the impact factor. Symptoms of a simple contact dermatitis appear immediately or shortly after the first contact with the stimulus, and the damaged area corresponds to the area of contact. Sometimes it is possible chronic dermatitis with prolonged action of the stimulus.<br><br> Optional irritants cause inflammation of the skin only in individuals with hypersensitivity to them. We are talking about diseases such as allergic contact dermatitis and atopic (allergic) dermatitis. The number of electives stimuli (sensitizers) is enormous and constantly growing.<br><br> Allergic contact dermatitis, in contrast to a simple, does not develop immediately after the contact with irritant, and the first contact. To an allergic reaction (sensitized) formed, requires several weeks from the first contact. Then repeated contact dermatitis develops. The inflammatory reaction of the skin does not correspond to the intensity of the stimulus that does not cause any changes in people without allergies. Area of skin changes may be beyond the contact.<br><br> Atopic dermatitis - a very complex disease, a chronic inflammation of the skin allergic nature. It may cause a few, and even a lot of factors - allergens, and thus not only contact but received inhaled (pollen, dust) or with food (food allergy). By atopic diseases also include bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, etc. Predisposition to atopy is transmitted genetically.<br><br> Atopic dermatitis usually develops in early childhood. Often the age of manifestation of the disease subside or disappear altogether.
<h2>Dermatitis symptoms</h2>
Simple dermatitis is acute or chronic. For acute dermatitis is characterized by bright inflammation, accompanied by itching, burning, pain, and sometimes - blistering and necrotic lesions that leave scars.<br><br> Chronic dermatitis appear stagnant edema, cyanosis, skin thickening, lichenification (desquamation), cracked reinforced keratinization, sometimes atrophy of the skin.<br> For the acute manifestations of allergic contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis are also characterized by a bright red skin with marked edema. Next, the bubbles can appear and even blisters, reverse and leaving oozing erosion (oozing). Decaying leaves inflammation peel and flake.
<h2>What you can do</h2>
When dermatitis is better to consult a doctor and do not self-medicate. In the treatment of simple contact dermatitis is the main termination of the stimulus. Most patients understand the cause of the disease, cope with it themselves.<br> However, there are cases (such as severe chemical and thermal burns, frostbite), when the intervention of a doctor just needs.
<h2>What can a doctor</h2>
In the treatment of dermatitis, you can help the dermatologist and allergist. If necessary, you may be referred to a gastroenterologist and other specialists.<br><br> Treatment of allergic contact dermatitis is assigned a dermatologist and focuses on the identification of the allergen. You ask in detail about the lifestyle, occupational hazard, cosmetics that you use, etc. With the exclusion of the allergen contact dermatitis symptoms usually disappear.<br><br> It is much more complicated treatment of atopic dermatitis. This disease should be treated by qualified allergist. Applied antihistamines (both for intake and ointments), glucocorticoid preparations allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT).
<h2>Preventative measures</h2>
Keep safety at the workplace and at home. If you have one already had allergic dermatitis, and the cause is known, try to avoid contact with the relevant allergen.<br> Main strategies for preventing atopic dermatitis is adherence to diet.
