<h2>General</h2>
Acne  occur when hair follicles in the skin become clogged due to secretions of the sebaceous glands and dead cells of the skin. Acne usually affect the face, back, chest and arms. The tendency to exacerbate acne can be inherited. Acne usually appears during adolescence in the form of small red bumps, sometimes large cysts and nodules. Usually after puberty, acne are alone. Acne is most common in men than in women.<br><br>
Acne can take the form of blackheads (open comedones), which is extended and clogged skin pores. Normally open comedones black or grayish-brown in color, due to chemical changes of sebum in the pore. Sometimes black dots may remove a doctor or beautician.<br><br>
The white dots (closed comedones, whiteheads) clogged pores with a very small hole. They are difficult to remove without medical care.<br><br>
Pustules white or yellow bumps that appear when inside comedones actively multiplying bacteria that causes inflammation and pus formation. Squeezing pustules may exacerbate inflammation and increase the size of the pimple. Cysts (cystic acne) is a deep, painful, pus-filled cavity, from which often scars.
<h2>The causes of acne</h2>
- Hormonal changes can affect the sebaceous glands, causing them to produce more sebum (oil), which leads to clogging of the pores, the appearance of pimples and blackheads;<br>
- Heredity;<br>
- <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">Stress</a>;<br>
- Use of certain medications, such as corticosteroids;<br>
- Frequent squeezing the skin (for example, a handset), or the habit of touching face with her hands.
<h2>The symptoms of acne</h2>
Easy-to-moderate acne (blackheads, a small number of pustules) require only a thorough self-care products. However, if after 6-8 weeks of treatment there is no improvement or worsening skin condition, it is advisable to see a doctor.<br><br>
If you have a very large, red, painful rash that will not go more than 3 days, you need to see a doctor.<br><br>
If you experience low self-esteem because of a skin problem and should see a doctor.
<h2>What can you do to treat acne?</h2>
In most cases, acne can be treated with various anti-acne OTC preparations (lotions, creams, gels). The most common ingredients in acne include benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, resorcinol, salicylic acid and sulfur. Benzoyl peroxide kills the bacteria that cause acne. Azelaic acid has anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory and keratolytic action. Resorcinol, salicylic acid and sulfur, although today it is not used as extensively as before, can help bring comedones (both closed and open).<br><br>
Apply the recommended remedies for acne every day to the affected area after cleansing. If the skin begins to dry and become irritated, reduce the frequency of application to once every two to three days. Independently not squeeze or break the pimples and pustules, it can spread the infection and cause scarring. Clean the face with a mild soap or other gentle cleanser (best to use products specifically designed for oily skin) twice a day. Wash your hair every day. Use moisturizers and cosmetics, water-based and marked "Non comedogenic", which means that these products do not clog pores.<br><br>
Use a face mask, which remove excess sebum. Avoid stress. Consult with your doctor if acne progresses, severe skin condition or if after acne scars remain.
<h2>What can a doctor do to treat acne?</h2>
Prescribe acne remedies containing tretinoin (lotions, creams), which help to reduce the sebum and thus, clogging of pores and stop acne.<br><br>
Write out antibiotics that kill bacteria and reduce inflammation. In a particularly severe acne physician can prescribe a drug containing isotretinoin for oral administration. However, be aware that this method of treatment has side effects. In particular, it is contraindicated in pregnant women or those planning to become pregnant in the near future.<br><br>
You can also do injections into the affected area of the various drugs that accelerate healing and reduce inflammation. This method also allows you to reduce the appearance of scars and blemishes.<br>
Regular use of topical preparations of acne in combination with medication prescribed by the doctor, will help avoid severe rashes and scarring (post-acne).
