Topical treatment of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/dermatology/psoriasis.html" title="Psoriasis">psoriasis</a> includes creams, ointments, lotions for application to the affected areas of the body and is used for mild and moderate psoriasis. These include:<br><br> - Glucocorticosteroids (betamethasone, triamcinolone, fluocinolone, etc.). This hormonal drugs which inhibit the inflammatory process, the activity of immune responses and the rate of cell division in the skin. Flaking of the psoriatic plaque decreases. The adverse effects of glucocorticoids include "habituation" and its skin atrophy, especially in the face of natural and folds. Therefore, hormonal creams and ointments should not be used for a long time.<br><br> - Calcipotriol (analog of vitamin D3) also inhibits cell keratinocytes. Generally well tolerated and is often used in combination with corticosteroids. It should not be used in conjunction with preparations of salicylic acid, as the latter leads to the inactivation of calcipotriol.<br><br> - Salicylic acid has an inhibiting division by the process of cell division and reduces inflammation.<br><br> Depending on the nature of skin lesions in psoriasis topical treatment also apply ointments containing zinc oxide, tar, boric acid.<br><br> Phototherapy (light therapy) is widely used in the treatment of severe, recurrent psoriasis and comprises primarily treated with ultraviolet rays. This suppresses excessive activity of local immune and inflammatory responses of the skin. It should be borne in mind that at any phototherapy observed side effects such as erythema (redness) and dryness of the skin in the application.<br><br> - BUF-B-therapy uses ultraviolet rays. Can expose the whole body or limited areas. There is special equipment for patients with small lesions, which allows itself to carry out sessions of phototherapy at home.<br><br> - PUVA therapy (PUVA = Psoralen + Ultraviolet A) is a combination of UV-A irradiation with systemic use of drugs, photosensitizers (psoralens). Before the patient is placed in a special cabin equipped with a UVA-lamps, it takes a tablet containing the drug from the group psoralen. Psoralens increase the skin's sensitivity to UV rays. To achieve remission necessary to from 10 to 30 sessions. Oral psoralen often cause nausea and <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/dizziness.html">dizziness</a>, so it is often replaced by bathing with a solution containing the drug. PUVA therapy but has a number of serious side effects. Due to the fact that ultraviolet rays reach the lens, the probability of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/cataract.html">cataracts</a>. Moreover, after a large number of sessions increases the risk of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/skin-cancer.html">skin cancer</a>, especially in the male genital area. In this regard, PUVA therapy applied with great caution and only in situations where local therapy is not effective.<br><br> Systemic therapy is used in severe cases and involves the administration of drugs that suppress the immune system and reduce the activity of cell division. Most drugs for systemic effects are appointed by mouth or by injection and have a number of side effects, especially those related to immune suppression and toxic effects on the internal organs, primarily the liver and kidneys. Therefore, systemic therapy should be strictly individual and is conducted under the control of blood tests. The drugs in this group include:<br><br> - Methotrexate (inhibits DNA synthesis in the cells and thereby acts cytostatic, i.e. inhibits the rate of cell division)<br><br> - Drugs retinoic acid (Acitretin), inhibiting excessive keratinization of the cells<br><br> - Cyclosporine A (Sandimmun-Neoral) which suppresses production of proinflammatory cytokines and T-lymphocytes, thus relieving inflammation of the skin.<br><br> - Antibodies to TNF-? (infliximab) block the action of tumor necrosis factor, a potent inflammatory agent and thereby normalize the process division and differentiation of keratinocytes.<br><br> In the treatment of psoriasis is often observed "habituation" of the body to any therapy. This requires revision of treatment. It is important to remember that in addition to medications, an important role in the therapy of playing lifestyle. Avoid <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/stress.html">stress</a>, give up drinking and smoking, diet, prescribed by your doctor. The diagnosis of psoriasis - no reason to despair. Since the disease can and must fight!
