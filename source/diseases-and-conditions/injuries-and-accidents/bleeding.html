Large wounds, especially if the involved artery, can cause severe bleeding. Depending on the type of wound and its location, can be damaged tendons and nerves. Bleeding from major injuries and / or deep cuts require medical intervention. In addition to external bleeding, there is also bleeding from internal organs. Any suspicion of internal bleeding requires urgent appeal for medical help.

When bleeding from a bite: squeeze the bite and try to raise the wound above heart level. With the help of cloth and mild soap vigorously wash the bite area with running water for 5 minutes.<br><br>

With little bleeding from cuts or scratches: carefully treat the wound with a mild antiseptic solution (hydrogen peroxide) to clean up dirt and foreign matter. Cover the wound with sterile gauze bandage or adhesive plaster. Every day, check the condition of the wound. If the bandage gets wet, replace it with a new one. After a delayed wound crust, you can remove the bandage. Consult your doctor if the wound flushed, swollen, does not heal, or warmer all the time dressing gets wet.<br><br>

Within 5 minutes, squeeze the wound on top of gauze or a piece of matter (in this time do not stop to monitor the wound and remove blood clots that can form on the gauze). If blood seeps through the gauze, do not remove it, and tie up a fresh bandage on top, continuing to put pressure directly on the wound.
