Classification of shock include: cardiogenic shock (associated with cardiovascular problems), hypovolemic shock (caused by low blood volume), <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/allergology/anaphylactic-shock.html" title="Anaphylactic shock">anaphylactic shock</a> (caused by allergic reactions), septic shock (caused by infections), neurogenic shock (disorders of the nervous system).<br><br> Shock is a life-threatening condition and requires immediate medical treatment are not excluded, and emergency care. The patient's condition at a shock can quickly deteriorate, be prepared for primary resuscitation actions.
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
