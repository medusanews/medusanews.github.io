The increase in the electrical conductivity indicates an inflammatory process in the appropriate body (eg at the point of tonsils with <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/otolaryngology/angina.html">angina</a>), and its reduction - for chronic diseases (such as cirrhosis of the liver at the points of the body). Thus the doctor is quite simple and safe method to get a complete picture of health. And most importantly, identifies the disease at the earliest stage of development, even before she showed herself.<br><br> The effectiveness of the method Voll are debatable. In any case, we must remember that electroacupuncture - just one of the ways to diagnose, available in the arsenal of an experienced physician.

So if you want to be tested by the method of Foll, it is necessary to resort to specialized medical centers, staffed by professionals.<br><br> The cost of admission can range from 600 to 3,000 rubles, depending on experience and professional ambitions, as well as the reputation of the medical center. Remember that in addition to the cost of admission will have to spend money on drugs that will pick a doctor.<br><br> HOW TO READ THIS DOCTOR?<br><br> Initial reception it lasts 1-2 hours.<br> You are accepted in the office, the doctor works with special equipment.<br> The doctor closely acquainted with your existing results of previous surveys, takes them into account when making a diagnosis.<br> The doctor works with gloves on.<br> Before a session you are asked to remove rings, earrings and other jewelry.<br> The specialist does not make a definite diagnosis of a serious illness, aims at further tests.<br> You are shown a printout of test results and give a prescription treatment plan.<br> The doctor did not try on the spot to sell you expensive drugs, citing a "threat to life and health".
