If one or more parameters are elevated, a pathology.<br><br> On analysis resort, if there is a suspicion of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/urology/renal-failure.html">renal failure</a> or kidney inflammation. Urine was collected for 6 days in the jar: one for urine released for every 4 hours. In the laboratory, they determine the number and proportion. Complex calculations, but it is important that the volume of urine passed during the day, was more than a night, and that the proportion of all batches ranged in a certain way.<br><h2> Here are the most common signals of a fault:</h2> 1010-1012. The density of urine equal to the density of blood plasma (isosthenuria). This can happen if the patient received diuretics or has non-acute <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/urology/pyelonephritis.html">pyelonephritis</a> or renal failure.<br> 1002-1008.
