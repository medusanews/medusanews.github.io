Computed tomography helps professionals to look more deeply into the body, detailed, layered structures and bodies to consider.<br><br> The study was conducted with the help of special devices - CT scanners with a rotating <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/x-rays.html" title="X-rays">X-ray</a> tube, which moves around the stationary patient, examining the body or part of it. The scanning speed of one layer (2-10 mm) is 2-5 seconds while playing back the image in black and white or color version.<br><br> The latest generation of these devices allows for a spiral CT scan. In this study, the tube moves continuously in a spiral, which gave the name to the method. The study is faster than usual and much safer for the patient. High-speed scanning produces sharper images, especially moving of the chest and abdomen.<br><br> It identifies the location of disease outbreak, the incidence of the pathological process, allows to evaluate the results of treatment, including <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/radiation-therapy.html">radiation therapy</a> approaches to select and volume surgery.
