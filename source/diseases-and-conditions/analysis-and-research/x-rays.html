Of course, no one can argue that the X-ray exposure to the organism is useful, but sometimes it's the only way to avoid a much greater evil, which can be applied to health and even life.<br><br> Under normal preventive examinations - chest x-ray, mammography - the person receives a dose of 0.8 mSv. By the way, an X-ray gives a radiation dose less than fluoroscopy. And with the dental x-ray image dose radiation and does a tiny - 0.1 mSv.<br><br> Flyuorografy and mammograms should not be done in one day<br><br> There are three methods of protection against X-rays: protection of time, distance and shielding. That is, the less you're in range of X-rays - the smaller the dose, the farther away you are from the source - the lower dose. As between you and the X-ray tube is a protective screen - you get a lower dose of radiation.<br><br> It is therefore important to use during the study with special protective means - "apron", "hat", "skirt" or "collar" with layers of lead. Young people who in the future will become a parent, you need to close the exposure of the abdominal area and reproductive organs.<br><br> X-rays are negative effect on blood cells and germ cells. The children should be screened at the whole body, except for the study area. In addition, the X-ray room has special protective screens and mobile screens.<br><br> How are conventional X-rays, known to almost everyone. They are executed either at the standard position of the patient behind the screen (X-ray), or recorded on film radiologist piece of research by "candling" (X-rays) of the patient in every necessary moment.<br><br> Contrast X-ray examinations of the stomach, colon and small intestine are made with oral or enema aqueous solutions of barium suspension. But the vascular structures and incomplete bodies such contrast is full. Therefore, in cases where it is necessary to study blood vessels, brain, liver, kidney and urinary tract, in addition intravenously injected into the patient's specific iodine-containing contrast agent (after the doctor checks to see if the patient has an <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/allergology/allergy.html" title="Allergy">allergy</a> to iodine).<br><br> Under the control of X-rays are carried out and such diagnostic (and also medical) research, as angiography and myelography. In the first case examined receptacles, the second - the spinal cord. These procedures are done only in a hospital, in a specially equipped operating room, usually under brief anesthesia.<br><br> MANDATORY PREVENTION<br><br> As a preventive measure, we need only two X-ray studies: a picture of the chest and mammography. First - to all who are older than 15 years annually, the second - only to women older than 40 years, every 2 years. If people have been doing regular chest X-rays, we would not have known outbreaks of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/pulmonology/tuberculosis.html">tuberculosis</a> and other dangerous lung disease. The same could be said for the prevention of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/oncology/breast-cancer.html">breast cancer</a>.<br><br> RADIATION DATA LOOKS LIKE<br><br> Radiologist puts obtained from the survey dose radiation passport, which is embedded in the patient's medical record.
