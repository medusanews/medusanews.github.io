90% of the blood - water. It dissolved proteins, fats, carbohydrates, salts, enzymes, trace elements... Any violation of the well-being of the body is immediately reflected on their content.

They are necessary for specifying diagnostics when he found trouble in the body.

There are 3 positions in brackets sprockets and one - for the left and right brackets. An asterisk right in the middle brackets - ideal figure. Shifted to the right or left bracket - standard, but on the upper or lower limit. The asterisk is located behind the bracket on the left - the result of lower than normal. Right - above it.<br><br> HOW TO DEAL "OF BIOCHEMISTRY"?<br><br> Blood on the analysis taken from a vein. If you are afraid, tell the nurse to warn: she will prepare a cotton wool with ammonia and will be ready for the unexpected. During the taking of blood to the side and turn away do not look like you will puncture the vein and fill the tube.
