<p>The test takes only 15 minutes from two years of life - often to hold it pointless. This densitometry, is the most accurate method for determining the safety factor of bones, your pass in the "Indian summer" without <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/injuries-and-accidents/fractures.html">fractures</a>.</p><h2>Test of strength</h2> <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/endocrinology/osteoporosis.html">Osteoporosis</a> we often take for age-related diseases, the inheritance of the elderly. This misconception is relaxing. But already 30 years old stores of calcium in the bones begin to shrink to 50 can achieve critical mass, and if time does not take action, it will be late.<br><br> Osteoporosis is curable, but only in the early stages. It helps to detect and X-ray densitometry.<br><br> PLEASE TO THE TABLE<br><br> This method allows you to quickly, safely and accurately determine bone mineral density: the higher it is, the more stable the bone to fracture. Fear of the word "ray" is not necessary - the irradiation intensity is 400 times less than conventional X-ray. Densitometer operator does not even use any special protection.<br><br> You do not undress, lie down on a long table, above you "floats" a special screen that "scans" the entire skeleton in two or more projections, if carried out two-photon densitometry. And only the bones of hand, forearm and lower leg, if single-photon densitometry. First preferred. Of greatest interest are the data on the mineral density of the cervical spine and proximal femur - the bone density in these departments initially less.<br><br> The procedure is painless, no advance preparation is required. The operator records the result of the densitometer and provides hands on report and pictures. Interprets the results and diagnoses other professionals usually rheumatologist.<br><br> DAILY RATE OF CALCIUM CONTAIN:<br><br> 1 liter of yogurt or low-fat milk<br> 200 g of hard cheese (parmesan, cheddar, Swiss)<br> 4 cans of canned sardines<br> 1 teaspoon sesame oil<br> 500 g almonds<br> 300 g of banana<br><br> US IS NOT BROKE!<br><br> Densitometry was necessary every 2 years to pass all women after the age of 45. But this norm only for those whose mothers did not suffer an osteoporosis who do not have menstrual disorders (including early <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/menopause.html" title="Menopause">menopause</a>) and who do not suffer from a clear lack of body weight. If your life, these risk factors are present, you have two or more children, or on the contrary, you have never given birth, and if you have had fractures, pass inspection before in 40 years.<br><br> If fractures have occurred in your life is often, hurry on densitometry, regardless of age. Physicians are advised to do the same, and those who are forced to take long-term corticosteroids (bronchial asthma, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/rheumatology/rheumatoid-arthritis.html">rheumatoid arthritis</a>), anticoagulants (heparin), diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide) and anticonvulsants (phenobarbital). Men are also advised to check the strength of bones, but later, after 50 years.<br><br> Densitometry able to capture even the smallest 2-5% losses of bone mass. So, and to identify osteoporosis at the outset, at the stage of osteopenia when it can still be corrected.<br><br> Results obtained with different devices in different hospitals may vary insignificantly. However, if you are undergoing treatment for osteoporosis, it is desirable to monitor the change in bone density at one and the same equipment to prevent getting incorrect results. This should be too time in 2 years.<br><br> Patients often have questions. Here are the answers to them.<br><br> <strong>Is it possible to do <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/ultrasound-examination.html" title="Ultrasound">ultrasound</a> densitometry and do not expose yourself to radiation?</strong><br><br> With the help of ultrasound measure bone density toe and heel - the patient puts his finger (or heel raises) in an indentation device. But it is less informative study. On its basis we can only make a preliminary report and, if necessary, to submit to a full X-ray densitometry of the spine, hip, or whole body, and after that will be an accurate diagnosis.<br><br> <strong>Some people prefer to have a full X-ray examination, it believable?</strong><br><br> Plain <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/x-rays.html" title="X-rays">X-rays</a> can "see" only the stage of the disease, in which over 30% of bone density is lost. It is prescribed only for the diagnosis of possible complications. In this case, perform an X-ray of thoracic and lumbar spine in the lateral projection. Early signs of osteoporosis, it is unable to identify.<br><br> <strong>Is it possible to identify a lack of calcium, and thus the risk of osteoporosis, according to blood tests?</strong><br><br> Osteoporosis is associated with deficiency of female sex hormone estrogen. But even if the analysis shows a decrease in their level, that is no reason for diagnosis, but only a pretext for further examination. A <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/analysis-and-research/blood-test-total.html" title="Blood test (total)">blood test</a> for calcium has no relationship to osteoporosis. In this disease, the level of calcium in the blood is normal. Just due to the fact that it is flushed from the bones. Thus laboratory tests on which could be an accurate diagnosis of "osteoporosis", there.<br><br> <strong>If the results of densitometry in normal, a prophylactic administration of calcium is not needed?</strong><br><br> Enough to ensure that the body receives the daily requirement of calcium (1200 mg) of products, primarily from dairy. If for some reason it does not work you can take extra calcium.
