Intragastric pH meter is a diagnostic procedure in which the measurements acidity in the stomach, esophagus or duodenum. This method has been widely used in gastroenterology due to the fact that the most common inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract are based on changes in acidity body lumen. In such diseases, pH-metry allows you to develop appropriate counseling and therapy and to monitor the progress of treatment.<br><h2> Indications</h2> The need to perform pH meters takes gastroenterologist. Indications for pH meters are<br><br> - Gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer;<br> - Various forms of chronic gastritis, duodenitis, dyspepsia,<br> - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)<br> - Zollinger Ellison syndrome;<br> - Barrett esophagus;<br> - Status after resection of the stomach.<br><h2> Procedure</h2> Basic research carried out by determining the pH, can be subdivided into the following groups: prolonged esophageal pH-metry, long-term monitoring of gastric pH, short-term intragastric pH-metry and rapid pH meters, endoscopic pH meters.<br><br> Each of the research involves the introduction of the relevant department of the gastrointestinal tract of flexible pH-metric probe. The probe carries the several measuring electrodes by means of which the acidity is measured at the point where this electrode is located. The probe lead through the mouth or nose. Depending on the purpose of the study can probe is in the cavity of the body half an hour, to a day or more.<br> Another option is endoscopic research pH meter. The measurement is made using a special endoscope pH probe introduced through the working channel endoscope. Acidity is measured at certain points of the stomach and duodenum, at least in the sigmoid colon.<br><h2> Prepare for study</h2> Set the pH probe should be done on an empty stomach. In the 12 hours prior to the study, patients must not eat, smoke. Reception liquids forbidden for 3-4 hours prior to the study to reduce the risk of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/vomiting.html">vomiting</a> and aspiration, and for the prevention of gastric contents alkalinity.<br><br> Limit of medication depends on the duration of their effect: so welcome antacids and anticholinergics to cancel at least 12 hours. Not less than 72 hours before the examination is canceled receiving proton pump inhibitors, H2-blockers, reception 24 hours before the start of the study.<br><br> In 24 hours or more long-term studies need to instruct the patient about his actions during this period. During the daily pH meters is recommended:<br><br> - to remain in the normal conditions for the patient;<br> - continue normal meal (preferably with the exception of mineral water, acidic foods and liquids, alcohol)<br> - keep a diary in which the patient must observe various time events and their duration.<br> When you express pH meters, pH meters short patient is in the office, sitting in a chair for 30 minutes to 3.5 hours under constant medical supervision. For such studies appropriate to use oral pH probes.<br><h2> Contra</h2> Contraindications to the study consist of contraindications to the introduction of a gastric tube and contraindications to the use of certain stimulants or inhibitors of gastric secretion. If the doctor advises you to conduct this study certainly remind him what other illnesses you suffer (hypertension, diabetes, asthma, etc.), which are taking medication.
