<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/endocrinology/acromegaly.html">Acromegaly</a><br>Acromegaly is characterized by a disproportionate growth of the skeleton, soft tissues and internal organs. If acromegaly is changed appearance, facial features become larger, increasing the size of the feet and hands. If untreated acromegaly leads to early disability in patients of the active working age, and increases the risk of premature mortality.
<br><br><a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/endocrinology/gestational-diabetes.html">Gestational diabetes</a><br>Diabetes is associated with the violation of the number or activity of insulin, a hormone that allows glucose transport from blood to body cells. If the body can not produce insulin in sufficient amounts or use it properly, increases blood sugar levels. Diabetes can not be cured completely, but subject to lifelong treatment can maintain the level of glucose in the normal range.

This means that insulin can not fully perform its function as tissue sensitivity to insulin is reduced. To maintain adequate metabolic control in such an environment requires greater and greater amounts of insulin that the pancreas is no longer able to provide.
<br><br><a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/endocrinology/insulin-therapy.html">Insulinotherapy</a><br>Insulin is a key regulator of glucose metabolism in humans.

These indicators will also help your doctor to increase the effectiveness of therapy and prevent complications.

Such a condition called "impaired glucose tolerance". It is dangerous not only to the development of clinical diabetes in the future, but also the fact that people with impaired glucose tolerance tend to be more severe course of disease.
