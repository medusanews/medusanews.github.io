<h2>What happens in the body when we move?</h2>

Any movement at the expense of the muscles. When muscular work is the energy source glucose. In a number of pre-stored glucose in muscle cells as glycogen and consumed as needed. When the glycogen stores in the cells is low, begins entry of glucose from the blood. In the active work of the cells become more sensitive to glucose, and admission to them of glucose requires less insulin. In a healthy person the pancreas in this case highlights a smaller amount of insulin, which prevents excessive lowering of blood glucose concentration. The patient has diabetes, which is on insulin or glucose-lowering drugs to prevent excessive loss of blood glucose may require adjustment of dosages and carbohydrate supplementation in the diet. Keep in mind that if you start to exercise the patient had moderate hyperglycemia, we can expect a decrease in blood glucose levels to normal. If prior to the exercise glucose concentration was normal, then after - there may be a hypoglycemic state. Always consult with your doctor about what kind of physical activity you are permitted and which can hurt, ask him, requires a correction of a selected sport or diet therapy.

<h2>What sports are recommended for patients with diabetes?</h2>

For patients with diabetes show a moderate dose, and physical activity, for example hiking, ball games, badminton, gymnastics, swimming, cycling, skating and skiing, etc.<br><br>

Not recommended for extreme sports, which can be life threatening in case of hypoglycemia (eg, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving).
Typically, patients with diabetes are recommended to engage in sports with family or friends who are familiar with the manifestations of diabetes and know what to take if a patient happens to the state of hypoglycemia.

<h2>Self-control during exercise</h2>

Intense and unaccustomed exercise need to be determined before and after them the concentration of glucose in the blood. Hyperglycemia, the allocation of glucose in the urine (glycosuria), and the more the appearance of acetone in the urine (acetonuria) during or after exercise showed a deficit of insulin. Keep in mind that the longer the load, the more likely the occurrence of delayed hypoglycemia several hours after exercise.

<h2>Correction Therapy</h2>

Diabetics respond to exercise differently. Therefore, each patient with his doctor to work out the tactics of self-control and adjustment of therapy in terms of physical activity. In sports should be carefully adjusted dose insulin to prevent hypoglycemic state or diabetic ketoacidosis.<br><br>

Intensive short-term load, usually require supplementation rapidly digestible carbohydrates, whereas long-term moderate load requires additional doses of insulin and increase the consumption of mixed meals.
