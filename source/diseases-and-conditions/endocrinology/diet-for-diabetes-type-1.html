<h2>Why stick to a diet</h2>

The primary treatment of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/endocrinology/diabetes-mellitus-type-1.html">diabetes mellitus type 1 (insulin-dependent)</a> insulin is competent and self-possession techniques. In this case the doctor is to choose a combination of medication and treatment regimen to minimize fluctuations in blood glucose in the blood and reduce the risk of possible complications. The diet in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 1 plays a minor role. Patients with normal weight in the absence of any complications during therapy, properly selected only need to limit the reception of food containing carbohydrate. The rest of diet diabetes mellitus type 1 corresponds to the full healthy diet, balanced and calorie content of essential nutrients. Current treatment regimens include the introduction of short-acting insulin three times a day before each of the main meals. Despite the fact that the insulin dose is adjusted according to the planned volume of food, a fully simulate the physiological rhythm of insulin in the body is quite difficult. After insulin administration "does not know" when and how much you eat. Therefore, patients with type 1 diabetes need to comply with certain restrictions in diet and rigorous self-control.

<h2>What eat? What not to eat?</h2>

Thus, patients with diabetes recommend a diet with a moderately reduced by energotsennostyu digestible carbohydrates and animal fats. Methods of heat treatment do not matter. Fried and spicy contraindicated only in patients with inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Previously, patients are recommended to a fractional power mode: 5-6 times a day with an even distribution of carbohydrates. At the present time, subject to modern modes of insulin needed such a strict regime and frequent meals there.<br><br>

What matters is that the dose of insulin injected before meals corresponded to the increase in blood sugar that occurs after meals. It should be understood that not all products are rapidly and strongly increased glucose in the blood. Saharopovyshayuschim action have mostly carbohydrates. Therefore, carbohydrates are eaten should be taken into account to calculate the correct dose of short-acting insulin. Carbohydrates are found in most plant products, and from animals only in liquid dairy products. Carbohydrates are divided into those who strongly and weakly increase of serum glucose after meals. The first group includes grains (breads, baked goods, cereals, maize), fruit, milk and liquid dairy products, some vegetables (potatoes), and foods containing sugar and other carbohydrate (fructose, lactose, maltose). All of these products increase blood glucose and should be counted in the dosing of insulin. Without counting can have the following products: cabbage, lettuce, greens, radishes, zucchini, eggplant, squash, peppers. A little more carbohydrates found in carrots, beets and beans (not counting you can eat no more than 200 grams of beans per meal).<br><br>

Strictly prohibited the use of sweet drinks (lemonade, tea with sugar, fruit juices, etc.) is limited to the use of sweets. Now comes a variety of sweets for diabetics. Their difference lies in the fact that they do not contain easily digestible sugars and sweeteners, which are not so much raise the blood glucose after eating. Divided into high-calorie sweeteners and no calorie. For calorie is fructose, sorbitol and xylitol. These substances of nutritional value correspond to glucose, but did not cause such a sharp rise in blood glucose levels. Preferred for patients with diabetes are no calorie sweeteners such as aspartame, saccharin, cyclamate, staviozid (Sucraseed, Aspartame, Surel, SusLyuks and up.). Unfortunately so far most of the products for diabetics include high-calorie sugar substitutes. Patients who are overweight, they are contraindicated. Pay close attention to the composition of products purchased in the department "for diabetics". And remember that even these products should be considered when calculating the dose of insulin.

<h2>We are accurate</h2>

For a more accurate calculation of insulin dose on the number of foods eaten developed a system of bread units (XE). XE is the number one product containing 10.12 grams of carbohydrates, such as a piece of bread, a medium-sized orange, 1 cup milk, 2 tablespoons of oatmeal with a slide. There are special tables for calculating the bread pieces in food. Knowing the amount of carb you are going to eat for receiving and measuring the blood sugar before meals, you can enter the appropriate dose of short-acting insulin. And then check the blood sugar after a meal. It is not recommended to eat for every meal more than 7-8 XE.<br><br>

Thus, for patients with diabetes mellitus type I (subject to normal weight), located on the right mode of insulin, the main thing is not what is, and then how to calculate the carbohydrate content in food.

<h2>Alcohol and diabetes</h2>

I would also like to say a few words about the reception of alcohol in diabetes mellitus. Alcohol has a specific effect on patients with diabetes are on insulin or hypoglycemic drugs. In these patients, alcohol intake can cause a drop in blood sugar levels to a state of hypoglycemia, which can be life-threatening. There is this phenomenon due to the fact that alcohol has the property that inhibit the output from the liver reserves of sugar and the usual dose of insulin in this case is excessive.<br><br>

In the intoxicated patient may not notice the first signs of hypoglycemia and do not take timely action to address it. But others can be attributed to the deterioration of health condition of intoxication.<br><br>

Receive unsweetened alcohol in small doses is allowed only for patients who are able to compensate. Type of alcohol and the dose should be discussed with your doctor.
