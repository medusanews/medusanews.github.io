Metabolic syndrome - a complex metabolic, hormonal and clinical disorders, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. At the heart of the metabolic syndrome is insulin insensitivity (the main hormone responsible for the uptake of glucose). This condition is called insulin resistance. In the blood and increases the level of glucose and insulin levels (hyperinsulinemia), but of glucose into the cells in the right quantity is not happening.<br><br>

Despite the fact that detected a genetic susceptibility to metabolic disorders, disturbance of lifestyle plays a minor role in the development of metabolic syndrome. Reduced physical activity and a high-character of the food are the main reasons that the incidence of metabolic syndrome increases. Metabolic syndrome affects about 25% of the population of Western countries. This disease is more common in men, women, its frequency increases in the menopausal period.

<h2>The causes of the disease</h2>

The metabolic syndrome contribute to hormonal disorders deposition of fat in the abdomen, above the waist. There is a type of abdominal <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="Obesity">obesity</a>. According to the results of recent research itself adipose tissue contributes to the development of insulin resistance. However, not all components of the metabolic syndrome can be clearly relate and explain the insulin resistance is not explored all the possible causes and mechanisms of insulin resistance in abdominal obesity.

<h2>Symptoms of metabolic syndrome</h2>

Violations of the combined framework of the metabolic syndrome, asymptomatic for a long time, often begin to form in adolescence and early adulthood, long before clinical manifestation in the form of diabetes, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/hypertension.html" title="Hypertension">hypertension</a> and atherosclerotic vascular lesions. The earliest manifestations of the metabolic syndrome and dyslipidemia are arterial hypertension. Of course, not all components of the metabolic syndrome occur simultaneously:<br><br>

- Abdominal-visceral obesity (waist circumference over 102 cm in men and more than 88 cm in women);<br>
- Insulin resistance at a high level of insulin;<br>
- Dyslipidemia (combination of hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL and increased the CL fraction of small LDL HL);<br>
- <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/hypertension.html" title="Hypertension">hypertension</a> (blood pressure above 130/85 mm Hg. Art.);<br>
- Early <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/atherosclerosis.html" title="Atherosclerosis">atherosclerosis</a> and coronary heart disease.<br><br>

Possible complaints: the fatigue, lethargy, shortness of breath, increased appetite, thirst, frequent urination, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headache</a>, dry skin, sweating.

<h2>Diagnosis</h2>

Diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, a doctor involved in the therapist, or an endocrinologist. At the reception, the doctor will conduct a thorough examination with measurement of weight and waist circumference, blood pressure measurement, collect a history of the disease. Next, assign a number of laboratory tests: a detailed biochemical analysis of blood from the definition of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, determination of insulin and sex hormones in the blood, etc.<br><br>

There are diseases that can accompany the metabolic syndrome and its complications be:<br><br>

- <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/endocrinology/diabetes-mellitus-type-2.html">Diabetes mellitus type 2</a>;<br>
- Excess weight, especially abdominal type of obesity;<br>
- Arterial hypertension;<br>
- Ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease;<br>
- <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/urology/gout.html">Gout</a>;<br>
- Polycystic ovary syndrome;<br>
- <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/urology/erectile-dysfunction.html">Erectile Dysfunction</a>;<br>
- Hepatic steatosis.<br><br>

If you find yourself the symptoms of the metabolic syndrome or you have any of these diseases should be screened to exclude metabolic syndrome and the need to undergo treatment. Early diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome is primarily a prevention, preventing or delaying the manifestation of type II diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular disease.

<h2>What will help the doctor?</h2>

Treatment is prescribed depending on the degree of metabolic disorders and the diseases that are identified in the patient. Treatment is directed at correction of carbohydrate metabolism, weight loss, relief of symptoms of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/hypertension.html" title="Hypertension">hypertension</a> and diabetes.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

In the treatment of metabolic syndrome extraordinarily important to precisely implement all the prescription. Only in this case, the correction of metabolism will be adequate.<br>
Activities aimed at reducing weight, abdominal visceral fat is the second least important condition for treatment. Events can be divided into a balanced diet and moderate exercise. The diet is tailored to body weight, age, sex, physical activity and dietary preferences of patients. Limited intake of fat and fast utilizable carbohydrates. The diet is administered a large amount of dietary fiber. Weight loss leads to increased insulin sensitivity, reduce systemic hyperinsulinemia, normalization of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, reduce blood pressure.
