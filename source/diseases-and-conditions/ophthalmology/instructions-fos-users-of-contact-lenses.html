Contact lenses are a popular, convenient and inexpensive way to correct poor vision.

<ul>
	<li>First of all, never use a double one and the same solution. This warning is no accident that it is written on every bottle with a solution. The solution effectively cleans your lenses, so the solution is already used contains a protein deposits from lenses and a lot of bacteria. If you use the solution again, he did not clean the lens, but on the contrary, "contaminate" them even more bacteria and older sediments. Thus, many times higher risk recorded in the eyes of a dangerous infection that can cause painful inflammation and redness, suppuration, and other more dangerous complications, including blindness. After each use, always dispose of the old solution from the container and rinse it with a small amount of solution.</li>
	<li>Before you put on and remove the lenses, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</li>
	<li>Every time you remove the lens, they must be thoroughly washed, cleaned and put in fresh solution.</li>
	<li>For daily cleaning of lenses using the method of "Rub and rinse" - that is, thoroughly rinse the lens and rub your finger on the palm of moistened lens on both sides for several minutes. This mechanical treatment can effectively get rid of protein deposits and bacteria.</li>
	<li>Never use tap water for storing contact lenses. There is a rare but very dangerous infection Acanthamoeba keratitis, which is found in tap water. Acanthamoeba keratitis is almost impossible to treat and can cause inflammation and irreversible damage to the cornea and cause blindness.</li>
	<li>Make sure that your lenses are not flushed with water (not tap water or water from rivers, lakes, seas, etc). Do not take a shower in contact lenses, as it is likely that the water splashes into your eyes and get on the lens.</li>
	<li>Carefully read the instructions for use of all your products to care for contact lenses.</li>
	<li>Do not use the solution after 1 month of opening the package and the solution was to have expired.</li>
	<li>Do not use solutions home or home-cooking. Buy in a pharmacy and only patented optics and recommended an ophthalmologist for you personally solutions</li>
	<li>Change the storage container for contact lenses every 3-4 months.</li>
	<li>Do not use contact lenses and care products for them without prior consultation with a specialist</li>
	<li>Follow all recommendations received from ophthalmologists to care for contact lenses. Do not wear lenses longer than recommended you to an ophthalmologist. The eyes should relax and breathe, even if you use the latest breathable and moisturizing contact lenses.</li>
	<li>If you have red and inflamed eyes, have any eye discomfort (dryness, irritation, a feeling of "sand in the eyes"), if you feel that you have worse vision, immediately remove lenses and consult your ophthalmologist.</li>
