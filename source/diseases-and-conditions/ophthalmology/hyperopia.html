Hyperopia is a feature of refraction of the eye in which images of distant objects in the rest of accommodation focused behind the retina.<br><br>

At a young age with a high degree of farsightedness is not usually possible to focus the image on the retina by means of the voltage.<br><br>

Causes of presbyopia include the following condition.<br><br>

The reduced size of the eyeball on the anterior-posterior axis. This situation is typical for most babies. That's why ophthalmologists recommend hanging rattles and toys at a distance 30 cm from the eyes, otherwise the baby they just do not see it. As growth and development of hyperopia the eyeball problem disappears by itself.<br><br>

With age, many people become farsighted. The reason for this decrease in the ability to change the curvature of the lens. This process begins around the age of 25 years, but only to 45-50 years leads to a decrease in vision, in which the reading at a normal distance (25 - 30 cm of the eye) becomes difficult. As a rule, to 65 years in the eye is almost completely lost the capacity for accommodation.<br><br>

The main symptom of <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/presbyopia.html">presbyopia</a> is poor near vision with satisfactory and very good distance vision. Typically, these people wear glasses to read a book, but can easily see the number of the bus, showing the distance. Only with severe hyperopia patient begins to distinguish between bad both near and distant objects.<br><br>

In addition, after prolonged use near the eyes (computer, reading, writing) in people with hyperopia, there are complaints of pain in the eyes, fatigue, watery eyes, burning and stinging in the eyes. The same can be attached and <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/neurology/headache.html">headaches</a>, discomfort when looking at the light or even a dislike of bright lights. Moreover, the higher the degree of hyperopia, the more unpleasant reaction to light.<br><br>

Hyperopia is of three degrees, which towers on the number of diopters, not the eye for a full view:<br><br>

Hyperopia of weak degree of up to 2.0 diopters.<br>

Moderate hyperopia up to 4.0 diopters.<br>

High degree of hyperopia more than 4.0 diopters.<br>

Typically, when a low degree of hyperopia the eye with accommodation on their own to cope with its task, and allows a person to see normally.<br><br>

But even at high hyperopia and high degrees of vision correction is required and given, and for close distances.<br><br>

I would like to see that vision correction for farsightedness should be mandatory. Not only for the normalization of view, but also for the prevention of complications. Such as <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/blepharitis.html">blepharitis</a>, strabismus, <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/conjunctivitis.html">conjunctivitis</a>, amblyopia (reduced vision in the worse seeing eye).<br><br>

With regard to treatment, it is now, unfortunately, there are no methods of conservative treatment of hyperopia. It can be corrected with glasses or lenses. But the cure is fully possible only by surgical intervention.<br><br>

Surgical treatment is aimed at strengthening the power of the optical eye. As a result, light rays are focused on the retina rather than behind it.<br><br>

Currently the most popular operations are replaced with long-sightedness transparent lens, termokeratoplastika, termokeratokoagulyatsiya and implantation of a positive lens.
