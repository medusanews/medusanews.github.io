<h2>Overview</h2>

Good vision in a child plays an important role in his training. According to statistics, vision problems are detected in one child out of 20 preschoolers and one in four students. Due to the fact that many of the troubles with his vision is just beginning at an early age is very important that children receive proper care of their eyes. Untreated eye problems can have serious consequences, as well as adversely affect the ability to learn, in school, and even a particular character. Below we present a number of problems with vision, with which the parents may face in practice:<br><br>

- Variety of lesions of the retina syndrome (Terry), there soon after birth, some premature infants undergoing changes in blood vessels of the sensitive membrane of the eyeball, which can permanently damage the eyes of the child;<br>
- Nearsightedness (myopia) when the image does not focus on the retina, and in front of her, resulting in blurred distant objects;<br>
- Farsightedness (<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/hyperopia.html">hyperopia</a>), the image is focused behind the retina, rather than on the retina, resulting in difficulty seeing people up close. In children, the eye lens is adapted to the problem and has made great efforts to provide clear images both far and near, but these efforts often lead to body fatigue the eye, and even to squint;<br>
- Defocusing (<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/astigmatism.html">Astigmatism</a>) - is usually the result of the irregular shape of the cornea. People with astigmatism typically see vertical lines clearer than horizontal, and sometimes vice versa;<br>
- Ptosis of the upper eyelid (ptosis), a defect in which the eyelids may be slightly lowered, or may even completely cover the pupil. There are cases where the defect may limit or interfere with normal vision, which requires surgical intervention, but in some cases can help and medicines;<br>
- Inflammation of the eye (<a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/conjunctivitis.html">conjunctivitis</a>) is characterized by a typical discharge, watery, irritated eyes;<br>
