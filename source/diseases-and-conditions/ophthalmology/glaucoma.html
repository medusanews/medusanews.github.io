<h2>Overview</h2>

Glaucoma is a slowly progressive degeneration of the invisible optic nerve, usually associated with chronic increased intraocular pressure.

Due to the balance of inflow and outflow of the liquid has a constant healthy eyes intraocular pressure. When glaucoma circulation of fluid in the eye is disturbed, it is accumulated, and the intraocular pressure starts to rise. At the same time suffers from the blood supply and innervation of the eye. In the beginning people just beginning to see the worst, and then breaks down peripheral vision, limited visibility zone and eventually blindness can occur. Moreover, these changes are irreversible, so it is important time to begin treatment of glaucoma. It is also possible glaucoma with an almost normal intraocular pressure. Most often in these cases, the pressure is kept in the area of the upper limit of normal, but blood flow to the optic nerve rapidly degraded and its functions are being violated.

<h2>Causes of Glaucoma</h2>

Glaucoma usually develops after age 40. Predispose to the development of glaucoma and diabetes, atherosclerosis. Established as a genetic predisposition to glaucoma.

<h2>Symptoms of Glaucoma</h2>

Unfortunately, there is a dangerous form of glaucoma, which occur almost invisibly and painlessly. The process of vision loss can be lengthy and may last for several years. And the patient says that seeing something is wrong when he is almost blind. This form of early diagnosis is possible only when the eye examination.<br><br>
Other forms are usually accompanied by pain and obvious visual disturbances such as periodic blurred vision, the appearance of halos around lights, pain in the superciliary and temporal region. It was under this form of disease possible acute attack - a sharp increase in pressure in the eye. The attack may be accompanied by nausea and general deterioration. Assistance in this case should be provided in the next day, otherwise blindness may occur.

<h2>Complications</h2>

In advanced cases of glaucoma leads to blindness.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

The earlier a person seeks medical help, the more successful the treatment of glaucoma.

During the glaucoma depends on your lifestyle. Avoid physical and nervous stresses. Limiting the severity of which is acceptable to raise - 10 kg. Avoid dark, as dark eye pupils dilate, which in turn contributes to intraocular pressure. In the diet should include mostly plant foods, it is desirable to limit the use of meat and fatty foods. Strong tea and coffee, spicy condiments, spices, pickles are also not recommended. But dairy dishes, especially fresh yogurt, vegetables, wholemeal bread, cabbage, prunes are very useful. The volume of fluid drunk per day, should not exceed 5-6 glasses If you are a smoker, you should as soon as possible to quit smoking.

<h2>What can a doctor?</h2>

The goal of treatment is to reduce intraocular pressure and bring it to normal. Sometimes this can be achieved with medication, but there are times when necessary, and surgery. If time does not start treating the disease, it may be blind, so at the slightest suspicion is necessary to consult a doctor, an ophthalmologist. All existing methods of treatment in a timely and proper use gives satisfactory results, and provide patients with preservation of visual function for years and decades, though not relieve glaucoma.

<h2>Prophylaxis</h2>

After 40 years, each person must undergo a preventive examination by an ophthalmologist at least 1-2 times a year. This is especially important for patients with <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/hyperopia.html">hyperopia</a>, family history of glaucoma and after eye surgeries.<br><br>

While there are no methods that can prevent the occurrence of glaucoma, but turned in time to a specialist, can greatly facilitate the treatment of disease.
