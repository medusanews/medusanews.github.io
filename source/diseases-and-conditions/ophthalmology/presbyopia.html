<h2>Overview</h2>

Presbyopia - is a pathology of refraction of the eye associated with age-related changes in the lens of the eye. Remember, as a child my grandmother asked us to help them put the needle thread, saying: "Something really bad, I was seeing".<br><br>

Most people with normal vision in his youth, is closer to 40 years begins to pay attention to the difficulties when placing small objects in the vicinity, and when reading the text printed in small type. The font seems non-contrast, spreads out. The eyes tire quickly. Firstly remove the text for a greater distance from the eye helps most people. But in the end it turns out that without the glasses is not enough. This process can be compounded up to 65 - 70 years, which will be manifested in the need to carry more and more powerful "plus" - glasses or lenses.

<h2>Causes of presbyopia</h2>

Our eyes - this is a complex optical system, consisting of a series of lenses. Vision begins with the passage of light through the cornea. Then, through the transparent intraocular fluid light enters through the hole in the iris (the pupil). Lens of the eye - the second lens in the optical system after the cornea accurately focus the image on the retina. With the ability to change its curvature of the lens (a process of accommodation), we can clearly see objects at different distances from us.<br><br>

With age, human sclerotic changes occur in the lens, which leads to compaction of the nucleus, and thus violated the eye's ability to accommodation. Therefore, a person needs reading glasses. This process progresses with age, resulting in an increase of plus diopters for reading, and approximately 60 - 70 years in the lens loses its ability to completely change its radius of curvature, and people have to wear glasses with plus lenses for the "near", and some points to "give". Unfortunately, this is the inevitable aging process, which can not be stopped.

<h2>Symptoms of presbyopia</h2>

Here is a sample list of complaints with which patients come to the optometrist:<br><br>
- Difficult to see small objects near;<br>
- Non-contrast looks fine print, the letters spread out;<br>
- To read the text, you need to take him to a large distance from the eye;<br>
- Fatigue and eyestrain when reading.<br><br>

Age-related changes are different people with different pathologies of refraction. For example, the presbyopia in people with congenital <a href="{{ root_url }}/diseases-and-conditions/ophthalmology/hyperopia.html">hyperopia</a> often manifested in the reduction of vision, both for reading and for distance. Thus, presbyopia worsens inherent farsightedness, and these patients require glasses with a big "plus".<br>
People with congenital myopia are in a better position. "Negative", which was a human life, compensates for the loss of an age of accommodation.

<h2>What you can do?</h2>

If you notice a decrease in their view, should consult an eye specialist as soon as possible. The fact that the reduction of the age of 40-70 years can occur not only due to presbyopia. For example, diabetes, often striking people in this age group is also can cause refractive errors. And in this case, the sooner treatment is started, the better the result.

<h2>What can make a doctor?</h2>

Presbyopia is detected during an eye examination and refraction at the eye doctor.<br><br>

Depending on the degree of impairment you need different glasses. If distance vision is good and there are only problems with near vision, easiest way to find glasses for near vision. In another situation will need bifocals (with correction for distance and near vision) or two pairs of glasses - one for distance and one for near. In addition, to date, has developed a number of surgical techniques and laser vision correction. Your doctor will recommend surgery if it considers that it can be useful for your option to reduce vision.
