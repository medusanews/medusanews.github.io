<h2>Very sharp decrease in the number of people who died of AIDS in 2013</h2>

<p>The results of UNAIDS published in July 2014 indicates that 1.5 million people died of AIDS in 2013, against 1.7 million in 2012, a decrease of 11.8% in a year, the highest drop recorded since the peak of the epidemic in 2005.</p>

<p><strong>In total, ten years, deaths from AIDS have declined by 35%.</strong></p>

<p>Regarding people worldwide with HIV, their number increased slightly, rising to 35 million today, against 34.6 million the previous year. That said, since 2005, there has been a decrease of 33%.</p>

<h2>New infections also fall</h2>

<p><strong>The number of people newly infected each year with HIV continues to fall:</strong> 2.1 million in 2013, against 2.2 million in 2012. But since 2001, new HIV infections have fallen by 38%.</p>

<p><strong>Children born with the AIDS virus are also decreasing:</strong> 240,000 in 2013 against 270,000 in 2012, a decrease of 27.6% since 2005.</p>

<p><strong>The most affected region is sub-Saharan Africa</strong> (South Africa and Nigeria in particular): 70.8% of those affected and still predominantly women (58%). In this part of the world totalling 1.1 million people died of AIDS, 24.7 million people living with HIV, including 2.9 million children.</p>

<p>To this day still, 22 million people have no access to treatment. 38% of adults have, against 24% of children.</p>
