If the patient in time refers to the proctologist, complaining of discomfort during bowel movements, itching, cracking or bleeding from hemorrhoids, you can quickly get rid of the early stages. However, the disease often becomes extremely sleazy. Almost all patients go to the doctor already after conservative <span class="demo-button-click" id="demoT7" onclick="banner = ban.venapro">treatment of hemorrhoids</span> is no longer effective. In this case, the doctor carefully examines the patient and determines the future strategy of the treatment of the disease. Often, the final stage of this process is the surgical treatment of hemorrhoids.</p>

<p>If doctors detect external hemorrhoids requiring mechanical removal, to begin the patient is usually prescribed minimally invasive techniques that do not require surgical intervention. However, they are not suitable for all patients, so a large percentage of people suffering from hemorrhoids, gets on the operating table.</p>

<p>Do I need surgery if you have hemorrhoids? As mentioned above, the doctors try to minimize the chances of radical treatments. If there is a chance to eliminate the disease conservative or non-surgical method, the doctor uses all techniques that can have an effect. Most often, the operation shall be appointed, if a person is present hemorrhoids grade 3 complications. If the disease is the first or second step, the patient may help non-surgical hemorrhoid sclerotherapy.</p>

<h2>How do the surgery and what to choose?</h2>

<p>Today in medicine there are two main types of surgery to remove hemorrhoids. First &ndash; this is a hemorrhoidectomy for Milligan-Morgan. Second &ndash; hemorrhoidopexy by Longo. Longo operation differs from the operation of Milligan-Morgan. With this procedure, the hosts themselves are not deleted, but removes part of the rectum. By removing a portion of mucosal blood flow is disturbed nodes, whereupon they atrophy. The intervention on the Milligan-Morgan exterior and interior nodes are excised and then sewn sutures.</p>

<p>How much surgery? Data close to the end of the article. On the appropriateness of the procedure you can tell your doctor. As for the criteria for the appointment of each of the types of intervention, they can be represented as a simple table.</p>

<h2>Do I need to prepare?</h2>

<p>Preparation for surgery is performed in both cases. Both types of procedures performed in a hospital, so patients necessarily prepared for anesthesia and the surgery in advance. Hemorrhoidectomy and operation Longo require prior hospitalization. As for anesthesia, then the operation can Longo local anesthesia, although most often it is performed under general intravenous anesthesia. Hemorrhoidectomy for Milligan-Morgan performed only under intravenous anesthesia. Also, the patient can make epidural anesthesia. Local anesthesia is hardly found. Preparing for Surgery Hemorrhoids usually are not too durable, but you can not avoid this step.</p>

<h2>How long is the surgery?</h2>

<p>Another criterion &ndash; the duration of the procedure. The operation to Milligan-Morgan takes about half an hour, and the operation Longo lasts no more than twenty minutes. Tolerated both procedures are equally good, but after the surgery the patient requires medical supervision. Treatment after surgery includes preventive tools for toning the veins.</p>

<h2>Stay in a hospital</h2>

<p>After the surgery, the patient remains Longo in hospital under observation for 2-3 days. When hemorrhoidectomy hospital stay may increase up to a week. Deserve special attention, patients who develop complications of thrombosed hemorrhoids: surgery in this case should only start after the relief of the inflammatory process.

Temporary disability after intervention by Milligan-Morgan can reach months, and after the operation is issued weekly Longo hospital.</p>

<h2>Pain</h2>

<p>How to be a painful operation? This question is asked all the patients who were prescribed surgical excision or removal of nodes of the rectal mucosa. According to experts, in operation Longo pain is negligible. In the case of the operation for Milligan-Morgan pain observed in the postoperative period in almost all patients. This procedure is a significant drawback, however, this does not diminish its effectiveness. While the patient is in the hospital, doctors removed the pain with the help of powerful analgesics.
