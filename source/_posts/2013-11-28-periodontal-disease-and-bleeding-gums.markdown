Bleeding gums is the most common symptom of periodontal disease &ndash; a complex of tissues surrounding and holding the teeth in the jaw bone. Despite the fact that by Parodont also include bone around the teeth and muscle ligaments that hold the teeth in the jaw bones, most people are faced with the problem of gum &ndash; regular or occasional bleeding, swelling and inflammation.</p>

<p>Many people mistakenly believe trifling periodontal disease and do not require emergency treatment of symptomatic &ndash; with &ldquo;harmless&rdquo; bleeding gums simply rinse their mouth herbs and do not go to the doctor. However, engaging in self-treatment, they cause serious damage to your health.</p>

<p>Fact that gingivitis (initial stage of periodontitis), the main symptom is bleeding gums, quite successfully (nearly 100%) is treatable if it initiated when the first symptoms.</p>

<p>If the disease takes the form of running, then there is a risk of losing teeth even at a young age. According to the WHO, 80% of children under the age of 10 years, there are already early signs of gingivitis, which is associated with significant physiological stress of the periodontal tissues in a growing body when cutting, shaping and growth of teeth.</p>

<p>For older people, because they have periodontitis tooth loss occurs in 95% of cases. However, there is good news &ndash; if only a few decades ago with the disease periodontitis keep the teeth was considered virtually impossible, the modern development of zubosohranyayuschih technology to successfully stop the destructive process.</p>

<h2>What is periodontal disease and periodontal disease &ndash; what&rsquo;s the difference between them</h2>

<p>Periodontal disease is a relatively rare disease (it accounts for only about 3 &ndash; 4% of the cases of periodontal problems), while periodontitis is &ldquo;honorable&rdquo; second among all dental disease (caries immediately after), and is present to varying degrees in nearly 95.</p>

<h2>Periodontal disease causes and symptoms</h2>

<p>Periodontal disease &ndash; is a non-inflammatory disease of periodontal tissues, which are due to internal disturbances in the body, leading to malnutrition and periodontal tissue perfusion and, as a consequence, to atrophy of the alveolar bone (bone edges of the hole tooth).</p>

<p>As a result of atrophic processes in periodontitis occur sclerotic changes in the bone tissue, reduced interdental septum, and the gums gradually become thinner and the like &ldquo;settle down&rdquo;, resulting in the effect of &ldquo;wedge-shaped teeth&rdquo; with bare roots. In the future, increased sensitivity to chemical and thermal stimuli, changing the color and the enamel is destroyed. Subsequently, as a result of running and complete atrophy, the teeth become loose and fall out much.</p>

<p>Local factors, in particular the impact of micro-organisms essential role in the development of the disease do not play, but serve only unfavorable factor aggravating.</p>

<h2>Periodontal disease symptoms and the stage</h2>

<p>Periodontitis, in contrast to periodontal disease, is an inflammatory nature and manifests the destruction of the connection between the tooth, gum and surrounding tissues, the formation of deep periodontal pockets and the gradual deformation and destruction of the bone hole tooth.</p>

<p>Because periodontal disease most often develops slowly and gradually over the years does not cause discomfort in the early stages it is quite difficult to diagnose. However, it should be noted that there are cases sufficient and rapid development of the disease.</p>

<h2>Step periodontitis</h2>

<p>First, the easy, harmless and effectively treatable stage of periodontal disease (gingivitis) is accompanied by a slight redness, inflammation and bleeding gums, bad breath and the formation of shallow periodontal pockets.</p>

<p>While moderate adds the following symptoms &ndash; a small tooth mobility, the emergence of cracks and gaps between the teeth, on education-and subgingival stones, difficulty in chewing food, deepening periodontal pockets (up to 5 mm) with a small selection of them.</p>

<p>In severe teeth start to hurt badly, offset, in part, loose and fall out, and deepened periodontal pockets and from their cavities are frequent and copious purulent discharge with an unpleasant odor.</p>

<p>Causes periodontal disease are diverse and the main of them are traditionally considered to be a lack of oral hygiene, however, all is not as easy as it might seem. Indeed, the microbes that live in the mouth and form plaque (stones), can affect the periodontal tissues, they cause inflammation and lead to loosening and loss of teeth. Therefore, periodic professional scaling is necessary, but, unfortunately, the lack of means of prevention.</p>

<p>Equally important role in the development of pathology plays the uneven load on the teeth, malocclusion uncorrected, errors prosthetics and jaw injuries. For example, periodontal disease often develops if removed 6th teeth and dentures soon not installed or improperly formed contact between the upper and lower jaws. Adverse effect might wear braces, microtrauma while cutting the thread, the habit of chewing on one side, leading to an overload of a separate part of the jaw, use as toothpicks metal objects, the effect on enamel acid and alkali.</p>

<p>It is important that the seals were installed correctly &ndash; do not protrude over the edge of the tooth, and at the same time, a close fit to it. If the seal is not tight fits, the germs and infections can easily penetrate to the root and destroy it, but if the seal hangs, it prevents the removal of plaque quality, and as a consequence, inflammation of the gum tissue. In case of improper prosthetic disease process develops locally, ie, only in problem areas. In such cases we say about the local gingivitis or periodontitis local.</p>

<p>In addition, the trigger for the development of the disease often appear overall negative factors for the entire body &ndash; lowered immunity, salivary gland diseases, endocrine diseases and malnutrition. In this case, the pathological process is developing in the area of ​​the teeth and is of a generalized (universal) the nature &ndash; of a generalized gingivitis or periodontitis.</p>

<h2>Periodontitis treatment</h2>

<p>Treatment of periodontal disease in the early stages, as mentioned, has a very good prognosis, so it is very important at the first warning signs, consult a dentist. First of all, you should alert the occurrence of bleeding when brushing your teeth and chewing hard food.</p>

<p>First, try replacing your toothbrush at a softer and more use toothpaste and mouthwash with the addition of healing, restorative and antiseptic natural components. If this does not lead to the desired result, you should immediately seek medical attention &ndash; periodontist, as the bleeding can not be ignored.</p>

<p>In the first phase treatment is limited, as a rule, professional cleaning and removal of plaque and use of folk remedies for periodontal disease &ndash; applications of aloe leaves and rinse with infusions and decoctions of medicinal herbs (chamomile, oak bark, sage, plantain). Traditional medicine with bleeding gums are also advised to rub them with sea salt, honey &ndash; Mix 20 g of honey with 5 &ndash; 10 g salt and rub the teeth and gums every day, not leading to injury.</p>

<p>In addition, the presence of periodontal pockets doctor offers them washing with antiseptic solutions &ndash; a process that helps reduce inflammation and swelling of the gums and reduce bleeding. If the teeth lose their stability, showed a temporary or permanent splinting especially strong ribbons &ndash; first on the tooth surfaces make the groove depth of about 0.5 mm, and then placed her in the tape and cover the filling material.</p>

<p>To gain stability, and widely used surgical techniques, in particular patchwork technique, transplantation of bone and soft tissues and artificial guided bone regeneration. Flap operation applies to the case where the gingival pocket too deep (greater than 5 mm) to reduce its depth. To do this, a small incision is made in the gum area and cleared of stones baring at the root. Then align the affected contour of bone and sutured incision.</p>

<p>Transplantation of soft tissue (taken from the sky) is applied at the tooth roots and bared for cosmetic purposes, and bone transplants (of their own bone or synthetic) used in significant destruction of the bone tissue for retaining the tooth, and for regeneration of new bone tissue.</p>

<h3>Treatment of periodontal disease</h3>

<p>Despite the fact that an effective treatment of periodontal disease is currently no exist as physiotherapy and surgical modern technology to recover gums and relieve itching, pain, hypersensitivity and other unpleasant symptoms.</p>

<p>Physical therapy aimed at improving blood circulation and regeneration processes in the periodontium. These include massage gums darsonvalization, vakuumoterapiya, flyuktuorizatsiya, gingival shower, UHF and magnetic-laser therapy. A good massage for the gums and the best prevention of periodontal disease is the chewing of solid plant foods. Abuse of soft refining food leads to exhaustion and bone atrophy, and with regular chewing solid foods, especially raw vegetables and fruit, on the contrary, there is a training vessel gums and natural cleansing of plaque.</p>

<p>Of the surgical treatment of periodontal disease using surgery to remove the periodontal pockets, removal of microabscesses and festering gums, bone grafting, removal of infected overgrown soft tissue closure of exposed roots, raised descended gums. One promising area of ​​treatment of periodontal disease is the use of cellular technologies to stimulate the recovery of their own bone. Similar operations are underway in Moscow.</p>

<h2>Prevention of periodontal disease</h2>

<p>For the prevention of periodontal disease should be serious about the state of their teeth:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 at least once a year to visit the dentist for a professional oral hygiene;</li>
<li>Brushing teeth 2 times a day, and possibly after every meal;</li>
<li>Remove it after eating the remains of the interdental spaces with dental floss;</li>
<li>To choose a toothbrush with rounded and not too coarse bristles;</li>
<li>Eat right. For periodontal health in the menu should be physiologically required amount of protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and trace elements. Do not abuse the sweets and eat more fresh organic fruits and vegetables.</li>
</ul>
