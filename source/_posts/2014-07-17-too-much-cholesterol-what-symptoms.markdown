What are the signs?">Some people wonder if cholesterol is accompanied by symptoms indicative.</p>

<p>If so, then these signs could indicate that it is time to calibrate their cholesterol.</p>

<p>This is unfortunately not the case&hellip;</p>

<!--more-->


<blockquote><p><strong>There are no specific symptoms manifested when an cholesterol excess in the blood.</strong>
We can not rely on any evidence to decide whether to calibrate their cholesterol checked and if all goes well on this side.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Excess cholesterol is a silent phenomenon as hypertension.</strong></p>

<h2>Symptoms of cholesterol are those complications</h2>

<p>It was only after years of evolution of symptoms may be too late, because the signs are then those complications of high cholesterol.</p>

<p>Recall that the long, excess cholesterol tends to be deposited in the arteries (plaque), narrowing their diameter and impeding proper blood circulation potentially causing arteritis members lower. This plaque can harden and cause angina. A blood clot can also form and detach, then going to butcher a coronary artery is myocardial or cerebral artery and is the stroke or renal artery is insufficient kidney.</p>

<p><strong>The symptoms of these accidents are well known</strong> (or should be because of the vital urgency):</p>

<p>What are the signs of angina?
Stroke or Heart Attack? Warning symptoms differ!</p>

<p>Overall, all symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular disease involving excess cholesterol are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calves pain;</li>
<li>Chest pain with tightness;</li>
<li>Nausea, dizziness;</li>
<li>Fever, headache;</li>
<li>Shortness of breath, palpitations;</li>
<li>Feeling cold extremities;</li>
<li>Loss of strength in the face, arms, legs, especially on one side;</li>
<li>Slurred speech;</li>
<li>Blurred vision;</li>
<li>Etc..</li>
</ul>


<h2>So when do calibrate their cholesterol?</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>The cholesterol assay based on a simple fasting blood test</strong> (after 12 hours without food and drink intake).
We can measure total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol (&ldquo;bad&rdquo;) and triglycerides, while LDL-cholesterol is calculated from previous values.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is recommended to calibrate their cholesterol once before the age of 30 to screen for familial hypercholesterolemia. Then the pace is every 5 years to 50 years and then every 3 years beyond because the arteries naturally harden with age. In case of diabetes, cholesterol is dose every year at least.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Thin also may have too much cholesterol!</strong>
If overweight and obesity increase the risk of having too much bad cholesterol due to an unbalanced diet, thin people can also suffer from high cholesterol and then it is usually a family phenomenon&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to age and diabetes, there are other risk factors that can lead to monitor your cholesterol more closely: family history of premature coronary heart disease, smoking, hypertension, overweight (or obese), waist excessive, etc&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>It is noteworthy that what characterizes excess cholesterol is precisely symptoms absence. This is why regular monitoring is required!</strong></p>
