Do they tan, can you be more exposed to the sun and they protect cancer?
Focus on solar capsules.</p>

<h2>Tanning and dietary supplements beta-carotene</h2>

<p><strong>Beta-carotene is a pigment that belongs to the family of carotenes.</strong>
It is found naturally in many plants very colorful, especially yellow-orange, like carrots, melons, peppers, apricots, as well as green leafy vegetables eg.</p>

<p><strong>Beta-carotene: an orange color of the skin</strong>
High doses of dietary supplements of beta-carotene (from 30 mg/day) or a very high consumption of foods rich in beta-carotene cause yellow/orange discoloration of the skin that doctors call &ldquo;carotenodermie&rdquo;. Such coloration is not hazardous to health and resolves when the amount of carotenoids absorbed decreases.</p>

<p><strong>An antioxidant against aging skin</strong>
Beta-carotene, also called provitamin A, is a precursor of vitamin A, which plays a role as an antioxidant, that is to say, it helps to fight against the excessive production of free radicals responsible for aging. Golden sun exposure are well known to accelerate the aging of the skin.</p>

<blockquote><p>For example, taking a dietary supplement beta-carotene (or adopt a diet rich in beta-carotene, and therefore rich in colorful fruits and vegetables) could accelerate the discoloration of the skin and therefore the tan, while protecting the skin from aging!</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>This is how many solar capsules are now available to enhance your tan, but their effectiveness in this area has not been formally demonstrated scientifically and without bias, as the duration of treatment and dosage to use.</strong></p>

<h2>Take solar capsules before going on vacation?</h2>

<p><strong>In the current state of knowledge, we can not recommend for or against solar capsules.</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>What is certain is that a cure of beta-carotene, even 15 days before exposure, during and after, does not relieve apply every two hours sunscreen with high protective index or n authorizes to expose longer or the hottest hours of the day.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, with or without beta-carotene, the main rules of prevention of skin cancer and accelerated skin aging are needed.</p>

<p>Finally, if you want to buy solar capsules should not exceed the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended daily dose. Also note that these supplements are cons-indicated in children, pregnant or nursing women.</p>

<h2>Beta-carotene and cancer: protective effect or a negative effect?</h2>

<blockquote><p>These are: an excess of vitamin A can be toxic to the body, but this is not the case with beta-carotene, the vitamin A transformation is blocked as if the vitamin A status is already high. Overdosing seems so limited with beta-carotene.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>For twenty years, studies consistently highlight the existence of a link between cancer prevention and beta-carotene</strong>: regular consumption, sometimes at high doses of beta-carotene would protect certain cancers.</p>

<p><strong>But, according to a study published in 2005 Inserm, this relationship is reversed in the case of smoking. Beta-carotene would be harmful.</strong>
Thus, smokers supplemented women see their risk of smoking-related cancers increase in proportion to the amount of beta-carotene consumed (20, 30, or 50 mg/day): lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, head and neck, thyroid, ovary, cervix, etc.. It is as if significant absorption of beta-carotene favored the formation of &ldquo;unusual cleavage products of carotenoids involved in the development of cancer&rdquo;. Note that this increase was observed both in smokers than in former smokers.
However, not all studies attest to this carcinogenic effect of beta-carotene dose in case of smoking. Thus, in 2012 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded reassuringly to the lack of increase of lung cancer in heavy smokers to levels of beta-carotene supplementation &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; (6 to 15 mg/day).</p>

<p><strong>So, do I take it or not solar capsules if I smoke?</strong>
To date, there is no reason to ban supplements beta-carotene for smokers, if consumed in reasonable amounts, ie less than 15 mg/day.
The best way to protect against cancer is to not smoke or stop!</p>

<p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>If you want to prepare your skin to the sun and enhance your tan, you can of course make solar capsules, but no guarantee of effectiveness except to have a more colorful skin! By cons, apply the dose indicated on the instructions of dietary supplement and in any case, apply sunscreen to protect you from UV.</p></blockquote>
