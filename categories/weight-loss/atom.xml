    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/diet-aphrodite/img.jpg" alt="Diet Aphrodite">In Greek mythology, Aphrodite - the goddess of love and <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/nine-day-diet/" title="beauty">beauty</a>. Therefore its name is often referred to as a <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/watermelon-diet/" title="weight loss">weight loss</a> diet, as an integral feature of female attractiveness is a slim figure. Variants of Aphrodite, there are many diets. Most often, the so-called power scheme, which is based on the use of Mediterranean cuisine.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Menu Diet Aphrodite is strongly reminiscent of a Mediterranean menu. Eat only a useful and <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/pineapple-diet/" title="health">health</a>y food. Carbohydrates, which are the direct cause of <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="obesity">obesity</a>, severely limit. The source of fats are fish, seafood, and vegetable oils, which are allowed to be added to vegetable salads.</p>

<ol>
<li>The diet of many fish and seafood.</li>
<li>It is recommended to the regular inclusion of seaweed menu.</li>
<li>Shrimp - one of the basic diet products. They need to eat at least twice a week, and if it allows the thickness of the purse, then more often.</li>
<li>Chicken should be a priority meats.</li>
<li>Lactic acid products need to drink before bedtime.</li>
<li>Allowed to eat eggs, but it is recommended to separate the yolk - it has a lot of fat.</li>
<li>In many dishes is recommended to add the celery.</li>
<li>Fruits and juices can be drunk in unlimited quantities.</li>
<li>Sweets and flour products are excluded from the diet.</li>
<li>Cereals and bread can be eaten only in the morning.</li>
</ol>


<p>In this embodiment Aphrodite diet has no restrictions on duration, caloric intake, the number of meals. But to know the measure, of course, necessary. Despite the dominance of the diet of protein foods and vegetables, plump with overeating can even be on these products.</p>

<h2>Diet Aphrodite with goat cheese</h2>

<p>The Internet is widely distributed another version of Aphrodite&rsquo;s diet with goat cheese. She is short, only lasts three days and is designed for <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/how-to-lose-weight-at-home/" title="rapid weight loss">rapid weight loss</a>. Menu of such a diet is clearly laid out by day. Power - Four.</p>

<p><strong>The first day:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Goat cheese - 100g of bread - 50 g.</li>
<li>A glass of yogurt.</li>
<li>Soup, which consists of mushrooms, cucumber, goat cheese and olive oil.</li>
<li>Vegetables and Goat Cheese.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Second day:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Oatmeal and dried fruits.</li>
<li>A glass of yogurt and an apple.</li>
<li>Vegetables and shrimp.</li>
<li>Goat cheese and scrambled eggs with tomatoes.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Day Three:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Egg, cucumber, 100 g of goat cheese.</li>
<li>100 grams of cottage cheese, a piece of fruit.</li>
<li>Goat cheese with mushrooms.</li>
<li>Vegetables.</li>
</ol>


<p>With such a diet can really lose weight. However, to do it for three days is not possible, but it is not designed for a long life. Therefore, a diet of Aphrodite on the goat cheese is unlikely to radically change your figure.</p>

<h2>Greek diet Aphrodite</h2>

<p>Probably the most stupid diet should be considered as the Greek Aphrodite. It is designed for weight loss, but the diet based on - carbohydrates, while protein-containing foods is limited. Menu options Aphrodite Greek diet consists mainly of:</p>

<ul>
<li>vegetables;</li>
<li>cereals;</li>
<li>pasta;</li>
<li>fruits;</li>
<li>nuts and seeds;</li>
<li>dairy products;</li>
<li>of bread;</li>
<li>legumes;</li>
<li>olive oil;</li>
<li>wine.</li>
</ul>


<p>These foods should be consumed daily. An intermediate position is occupied by the food recommended to be put on the table, no more frequently than every other day:</p>

<ul>
<li>honey;</li>
<li>chocolate;</li>
<li>seafood;</li>
<li>a fish;</li>
<li>eggs.</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, in the least favored by the creators of the meat of the Greek diet. Oil-rich generally prohibited. But chicken or veal to use as possible, but not more than three times a month. What thoughts <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/why-should-you-run-benefits-and-harms-of-running/" title="running">running</a> through my head of people who compose this diet, we do not know. But if you do not want to multiply the fat reserves on your stomach, it is better to give it up.</p>

<h2>Menu watermelon diet for 3 days</h2>

<p>The main thing for this diet - a strict limit of watermelon consumption depending on the initial weight. For example, if you weigh 70 kg, then the day you can eat no more than 7 kg of watermelon. That is, 10 kg of 1 kg is allowed watermelon.</p>

<p>Nothing else is allowed to eat, but you can drink as much as you want. Allowed to drink water, and green tea in any amount. Alcohol should be excluded completely.</p>

<h2>Watermelon diet for 8-10 days</h2>

<p>The diet of this diet is not as hard as in the first case. It is allowed in addition to watermelon to eat at each meal 2 slices of rye bread. Follow the diet should be 8-10 days. Other products can not eat.</p>

<p>Not recommended to follow this diet for more than 10 days, but if it is right to go out of it, you can significantly improve your score. To do this, proteins were gradually introduced into the menu, fats and carbohydrates, but only gradually, not otherwise. Before going to bed for an additional 10 days to eat a few slices of watermelon, but not much. Do not have dinner after 20.00. If you eat right for another 10 days, you can lose weight by 2-3 kg, but not as rapidly as during a diet, but the result will be more stable.</p>

<p><strong>Pros watermelon diet:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the main advantage - it is satiety. Each of us knows how to eat the heart of a ripe, juicy, red flesh and not &quot;die&quot; from overeating, because after half an hour, your body expels excess fluid, and you feel like a new person;</li>
<li>enough high efficiency, but it is worth noting that most <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/pineapple-diet/" title="weight loss">weight loss</a> with the help of watermelon diet - it is removing excess fluid from the body;</li>
<li>diet normalizes metabolism.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Cons watermelon diet:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the first and most important negative - it is a contraindication to watermelon diet for kidney and urinary tract;</li>
<li>another minus - not a balanced diet. Just like any other mono-diet, it does not provide a complete diet, but rather poor in proteins and fats, which in varying degrees, the body needs.</li>
</ul>


<p>Whatever it was, watermelon lovers with healthy kidneys watermelon waiting for a few pleasant days for which you can reduce your weight.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/model-diet/img.jpg" alt="Model diet">Judging by the name, the model diet is intended for the purchase of model appearance. However, judging by its duration, it is unlikely to reach its goal. Model Diet is one of the short circuit power to lose weight. In one embodiment, it takes 3 days, in another - 7 days. Let&rsquo;s get acquainted with them.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Model diet for 3 days</h2>

<p>It is unlikely that the model used the diet, which will be discussed. Rather, they use a more healthy ways to lose weight under the supervision of doctors. But the title of this three-day supply circuit stuck. diet menu model for 3 days as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Breakfast</strong> - one boiled egg or boiled;</li>
<li><strong>Dinner</strong> - 300 g of raw vegetables, can be in the form of salad, 2 fruit, 100 g of fish steamed.</li>
</ul>


<script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

<p><ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-8970873924341937"

<p>Impossible to lose weight in 3 days at this menu. For such a short period of time at all you can not change the contours of the figure. Model diet limits caloric intake, but not so much that people lost weight. In addition, in the evening the candidates in the model are invited to taste the bread and butter, which violates several rules of diet.</p>

<p>Usually carbohydrates are consumed in the morning, so the body can use them up during the day. But the model diet allows you to eat an egg for breakfast only, half-day so people have to embarrass colleagues his rumbling stomach. In the evening, a candidate in the model would be a good idea to eat a light dinner consisting mainly of proteins and containing a minimum of <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/figs-diet-for-weight-loss/" title="calories">calories</a>. But no, he eats a calorie sandwich with butter, consisting of fats and carbohydrates.</p>

<p>Perhaps, it is possible to lose a few kilos for a month on a model diet. But so long it withstand very difficult. Besides, it is designed only for 3 days. During this time, you will surely not be able to buy a model appearance.</p>

<p>But there is another version of the diet. It is a hard and probably reduces the weight even by removal of bowel contents. If you need to urgently improve the shape of your abdomen, you can use the following diet:</p>

<p><strong>Dinner (no later than 15 hours)</strong> - 100 grams of cottage cheese.</p>

<p>Diet is very difficult. It is harmful to health and brings only a temporary effect. Therefore it is better to pay attention to diet to lose weight at the expense of allowing the splitting of fat, rather than create the illusion of a flat stomach as a result of bowel emptying.</p>

<h2>Model diet for 7 days</h2>

<p>The seven-day model diet is more forgiving than both variants diet for 3 days. It involves three meals a day. Menu is very flexible. Low calorie diet, the amount of food is small. But the model diet for 7 days makes it possible to more or less normal breakfast, lunch and even dinner.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Breakfast</strong> - a small piece of boiled meat, two eggs, bread and butter, tea;</li>
<li><strong>Lunch</strong> - fish or meat (no more than 100 g), 2 fruit, 250-300 g of vegetable salad with green peas;</li>
<li><strong>Dinner</strong> - a salad of green vegetables (300 g), two slices of bread and butter.</li>
</ul>


<p>Throughout the diet should drink water. It is advisable before each meal consumed green tea - at least one glass at a time. Additional fluid can overcome hunger.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have a diet rapid analysis. Obviously, the base diet - a protein-containing products and vegetables. One would assume that the diet allows you to lose weight by restricting carbohydrates. But one day a person eats three slices of bread with butter and two pieces of fruit, which, although they do not have a high-calorie, contain simple sugars. This limitation is not enough sugar to lose weight, even if the diet is observed for months.</p>

<p>However, it is likely that a person will be able to get rid of a small amount of fat due to the low calorie diet. Because dense foods on the menu only oil is present. But it is not enough - only a few grams. The relatively high nutritional value has bread. The rest of the food - it is vegetables, fruits, lean meat, eggs and fish. These products are considered useful for the figure.</p>

<p>Energy value of the daily diet is about 1000 kcal. Perhaps it will suffice to the amount of fat in your body has decreased by 0.5-1 kg. It is unlikely in the model diet for only 7 days you will be able to lose weight more. If you cut off a huge loaf of bread instead of a small piece, and inflict on him the oil layer two inches thick, you soon get better than that reduce weight.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/banana-diet-menu/img.jpg" alt="Banana diet">Bananas - a fruit that have a sufficiently high calorific value. Most people are aware of this and try to avoid them in the diet. However, there are power circuits, which involve the use of banana as the major product. Is it possible to lose weight on these fruits? Are there effective diets that reduce weight with the help of bananas? Let&rsquo;s analyze the three most common <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/banana-diet-for-3-days-and-7-days/" title="banana diet">banana diet</a> and make conclusions.</p>

<h2>Banana diet for 3 days</h2>

Lose weight for 3 days - the dream of every woman. As a rule, such a need arises at them before going to the beach this weekend, in case of sudden visits or New Year&rsquo;s Eve. The majority of women for some reason do not realize that it is impossible to lose weight in 3 days. Even in the case of complete <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/starvation.html" title="starvation">starvation</a> the body begins to vigorously break down subcutaneous fat only a few days after the rejection of food.</p>

<p>But the most common version of the banana diet offers <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/nine-day-diet/" title="weight loss">weight loss</a> was 3 days. According to this method of fans to reduce weight, such a short period of time is sufficient to reduce their body weight by three kilograms. Banana essence diet on day 3 is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>there can be only bananas;</li>
<li>three times a day people should eat a banana and wash it down with a glass of milk;</li>
<li>milk should be lean;</li>
<li>at other times any food and beverages except water, are prohibited.</li>
</ul>


<p>It is unlikely to 3 days on a diet could achieve a significant improvement in the figures. But surely abide by it will not be too difficult. Bananas and milk enough nutrients to not feel wild hunger in the diet period. At the same time they do not contain a lot of <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/figs-diet-for-weight-loss/" title="calories">calories</a>, so the banana-milk days people will spend more energy than it will receive from food.</p>

<p>Still, 3 kilograms of weight to lose can not be sure. Even given that bananas have a mild diuretic effect due to the content of potassium salts from your body will not leave as much fluid you to become significantly easier. Banana diet for 3 days only help relieve digestive system, giving it a breathing space. But for weight loss need much longer.</p>

<h2>Banana diet for 7 days</h2>

<p>Banana diet for 7 days provides a more solid results. On the Internet you can read that it can help a person will lose one kilogram of weight per day. That is, the end of the diet he folds 7 kilograms of fat. These results are possible even in the event of complete failure of the food. Nevertheless, we will introduce you with such an embodiment of the banana diet. Its essence is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>you can only eat bananas;</li>
<li>restricted their consumption of 1.5 kg per day;</li>
<li>you can drink only water and green tea - in any quantity;</li>
<li>you can eat in either mode, but the last meal - no later than 19 hours;</li>
<li>to avoid starvation, it is desirable not to eat at one time more than one banana;</li>
<li>if bananas are completely fed up, you can enter into the diet of two boiled eggs in a day.</li>
</ul>


<p>Bananas - not the best diet product. It is not clear what criteria guided the creators of this diet, choosing bananas as the sole source of nutrients. They are sweet, because they have a lot of sugar. Even far from nutrition person knows that the sweet recover and not lose weight. Bananas have a high glycemic index, consist mainly of carbohydrates and thin because they are not very convenient.</p>

<h2>Cottage cheese and banana diet</h2>

<p>Cottage cheese and banana diet lasts for six days. Three of them - the banana. Yet three days - cheese. Start with cottage cheese day. Check, respectively, have a banana. The diet is more varied diet, compared with the previous power schemes. cheesecake of the day menu looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>breakfast - 120 grams of low fat cottage cheese, a grapefruit;</li>
<li>lunch - 120 grams of low fat cottage cheese, a slice of melon;</li>
<li>dinner - again, 120 g of cottage cheese and grapefruit.</li>
</ul>


<p>Why cheese? It contains a lot of protein and little sugar. It has a low calorie, but nourishes by a viscous consistency, high-volume, slow progress on the gastrointestinal tract.</p>

<p>Why grapefruit? Rumor has it that it promotes weight loss. And although it is fiction, many believe in the fat burning properties of grapefruit.</p>

<p>Why melon? Her presence in the diet does not seem logical. In this fruit a lot of sugar, and it has a high glycemic index. Melon is harmful for the figure, and most diets for weight loss exclude it from the diet.</p>

<p>Banana days include the following menu:</p>

<ul>
<li>breakfast - a banana and a glass of milk;</li>
<li>lunch - banana and boiled egg;</li>
<li>dinner - 200 grams of banana and chicken.</li>
</ul>


<p>Eggs, milk and chicken contain a lot of protein. They are low in carbohydrates, so these dietary products can be called. And that&rsquo;s why in this scheme bananas - are not known. If they were replaced by other, less high-calorie fruit, the good of diet would be more. However, not much. Like other short-circuit power for weight loss, banana curd diet does not allow to achieve significant results in reducing weight.</p>
