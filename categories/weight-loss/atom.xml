<p>It can be described as: a low-calorie, low-fat, low-carb, high-protein. At first glance, perfect, containing no food components, is converted into fat, and includes only the necessary nutrients for life. In general, this diet is really very effective and, importantly, not &quot;hungry&quot;, but it has its drawbacks, which we will touch upon later.</p>

<p>Diet lasts 4 weeks, and during this time you need to follow a well-defined menu, which occupies a central place cottage cheese. Excesses and going beyond the list of approved products is prohibited; not recommended even pick up food analogues suggested, for example, replace the chicken. If the menu designated fruit or vegetables, among the first need not <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/choosing-a-anti-stretch-marks-cream-after-giving-birth/" title="choose">choose</a> sweet (grape, melon, dried fruit, bananas), and among the second preference amyloid (especially potatoes).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/baths-with-sea-salt-for-weight-loss/img.jpg" title="Baths with sea salt for weight loss" alt="bath with salt for weight loss">Sea salt has been used in ancient Greece and was used as a treatment for various diseases: nervous, <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/vascular-disease/" title="vascular disease">cardiovascular diseases</a>, diseases of the musculoskeletal system. Today, in the foreground is the use of sea-salt diet and getting rid of cellulite. Is it worth it to consider this remedy so much a reliable partner in the fight against <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="obesity">obesity</a>?</p>

<p>It is known that sea salt has a rich mineral structure, which ensures its beneficial properties. Seawater contains almost half of the periodic table, and a similar chemical composition is derived from its salt. Today sea salt is obtained in the same ways that a century ago - by evaporation. The elements contained in sea water in the greatest concentration, remain dry sea salt. These include:</p>

<p><em>Sodium and potassium</em> - contribute to the removal of the cells of the body of metabolic products.</p>

<p><em>Bromine</em> - has a calming effect on the nervous system.</p>

<p>In small quantities of sea salt in the presence of <em>gold, silver, palladium, selenium, boron, manganese, zinc, silicon, nickel</em>, and other minerals.</p>

<p>Concentrated saline is slightly irritating epidermis, increasing blood flow in small blood vessels. Because of this, the metabolic processes in the cells of the skin and subcutaneous tissue increase. Thus, salt bath help to improve skin appearance and to some extent reduce the appearance of cellulite. Salt also has anti-inflammatory properties, dries small foci of inflammation, so that the skin after bath salt looks more smooth and even.</p>

<p>Although bath and cosmetic products with sea salt is recommended for <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/gone-month-after-weight-loss-how-to-restore-the-month-following-the-diet/" title="weight loss">weight loss</a>, the very salt of any fat burning properties are not allowed. And &quot;weight loss&quot; after a bath with sea salt does not occur because of the volume reduction of body fat. Just by dissolving the salt in water to create a hot hyperosmotic solution that extends from the body &quot;extra&quot; liquid and reduces swelling.</p>

<p>Soothing or, conversely, a tonic effect bath with sea salt can be obtained by adding to the water an essential oil or a decoction of herbs with the appropriate action.</p>

<p>The implications are clear: such procedures do not allow to lose weight, but they may help a bit to lose weight by providing the body drain effect. They also help in the fight against cosmetic defects of the skin and affect overall health.</p>

<p>Sea salt bath can be purchased in almost any pharmacy or store. It is better to <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/choosing-a-anti-stretch-marks-cream-after-giving-birth/" title="choose">choose</a> a salt without any coloring and flavoring agents, because the contact with them may cause skin irritation or allergic reaction.</p>

<p>The amount of salt required for a bath, generally indicated on the packaging. Typically, the means take 300-500 grams per 200 liters of water. Adding more salt than is recommended, in the hope of a more pronounced effect, you only get increased dryness and flaking of the skin. Keep this in mind and avoid &quot;overdose&quot;.</p>

<p>Before taking a bath with sea salt Rinse under the shower. The required quantity of salt is dissolved in a liter of hot water, and then pour the solution into the water bath. You should select water temperature in the bath, it is comfortable for you, but remember that it should not be higher than 38 degrees. More hot water will dry the skin. In the water you can add your favorite essential oil or a decoction of herbs that enhance the action of the bath. Thus, essential oils of citrus fruits (lemon, orange, grapefruit) increase the effect of anti-cellulite treatments.</p>

<p>Immersed in the bath must not more than 10-20 minutes, at this region of the heart must remain above water. After the bath, you need to take a shower and put on a skin moisturizer. Then comes <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/body-wraps-for-weight-loss-belly/" title="wrap">wrapped</a> in a sheet or a bathrobe and sit or lie down quietly for half an hour. Within 1-2 hours before and after the bath should not eat, but you can drink green tea or herbal decoction.</p>

<p>Baths with sea salt are not for everyone, and have a list of contraindications. These include skin, heart and gynecological diseases, <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/vascular-disease/varicose-veins.html" title="varicose veins">varicose veins</a>, increased body temperature, the condition of alcoholic intoxication, <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/choosing-a-anti-stretch-marks-cream-after-giving-birth/" title="pregnancy">pregnancy</a>. If you have doubts about their safety for you personally, before the start of the procedures would be better to consult a doctor.</p>

<p>You can find a variety of opinions about the use of baths with sea salt. Among them there are also totally implausible: that someone has lost 10 kilograms in just a two weeks alone baths. To believe such statements are not worth it.</p>

<p>More than adequate people actually experienced the effects of sea salt, write to relieve fatigue and improve skin after these procedures. Weight is reduced by only a few kilograms in such baths combined with diet and physical activity. The achieved result is possible to keep under the same conditions.</p>

<p>From the available options in the sale of sea salt most people like the salt of the Dead Sea. Indeed, it has a unique chemical composition, wherein the proportion of sodium chloride accounts for only about 20%, and the remaining 80% - other minerals. Their relatively high content, and provides a more pronounced effect of water treatments.</p>

<p>Thus, a bath with sea salt should not be considered as the basis for weight loss, but rather as an aid provider cosmetic and soothing effect. But weight loss is still achieved a healthy diet and exercise, and do not expect that without them you can achieve noticeable results in the achievement of harmony.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/belly-massage-for-weight-loss/img.jpg" title="WBelly massage for weight loss" alt="belly massage for weight loss at home"><strong>Massage</strong> - a method that has long been in service with the conventional medicine. It is approved by the Ministry of Health, and is used to treat a huge number of diseases. Of course, as an auxiliary method of therapy. Massage is used in virtually all areas of medicine. He is firmly entrenched in our lives, and probably in the world there is not one person who would never lay on a massage table.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The effectiveness of massage</h2>

<p>The effectiveness of massage has long been proved. It can help you improve the condition of the patient, regardless of the disease, which he suffers. However, the inability of the placebo-controlled studies leaves some doubt as to the mechanism of its effects. Which factor plays the most important role: the psychological or physiological? What makes a person feel relieved: relaxation and faith in the healing power of massage or mechanical effect on the soft tissues of the body?</p>

<p>This question remains open for the time being. We are interested in, whether it is possible with the help of abdominal massage to lose at least a few kilograms? Agree, it would be great: no need to starve, no strain, just lie down on the table, belly up, and wait for someone skilled hands make short work of your fat. Is it possible? Let&rsquo;s deal.</p>

<p>All the effects of the massage can be divided into psychological and physiological. The first is certainly very useful, but are unlikely to have a specific and predictable effect on the weight of your body. Therefore, it makes no sense to consider them, go directly to the physiological. We will not engage in speculation, use a pseudo-data, for example, on energy currents - too. That&rsquo;s the impact on the human body has a significantly abdominal massage:</p>

<ul>
<li>Warms the skin due to emitted as a result of mechanical friction heat;</li>
<li>Stimulates the microcirculation of the skin by heating;</li>
<li>It stimulates the flow of lymph and venous blood due to mechanical compression of blood vessels;</li>
<li>Relaxes the muscles by mechanical action on them, as well as enhance blood flow.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Belly massage and weight loss</h2>

<p>Which of these mechanisms, in your opinion, can contribute to <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/gone-month-after-weight-loss-how-to-restore-the-month-following-the-diet/" title="weight loss">weight loss</a>? Let&rsquo;s look at them all in turn.</p>

<p>Obviously, warm skin of the abdomen can not dissolve fat. It does not melt like wax, so the effect of massage is unlikely to reduce the weight of your body. Judge for yourself if the increase in skin temperature contribute to weight loss, for the acquisition of a slim figure you would rather stick a couple of yellow cards in the stomach, or heat it with an ordinary table lamp. From the sea, everything is back to not only rested, but also slim, because the fat left on the beach not only the stomach, but also from the entire body.</p>

<p>The skin temperature increases by touching hand massage, so the blood vessels dilate to give away excess heat. This is one of the mechanisms of thermoregulation, protects the body from overheating. Due to dilation of small blood vessels nutrition improves soft tissues, primarily the skin. Does this mean that fat belly will start to leave? No, otherwise all alcoholics with red faces would not wear belly in his hands, and would look more slender birch. Medicines from the group of proofreaders microcirculation, led by pentoxifylline, have themselves become popular drugs for weight loss.</p>

<p>This effect helps to eliminate stagnant lymph and venous blood. Thus, the massage display allows the liquid that has accumulated in the soft tissues. Perhaps it is this feature made people consider massage as a regular method of losing weight. <strong><em>Firstly</em></strong>, with the fluid leaves the body weight, that causes a person to believe that massage helped him to break down fat. <strong><em>Second</em></strong>, visually stomach becomes more flat. This is due to improvement of the skin and removal of liquid. <strong><em>Third</em></strong>, the possible reduction in waist circumference, again, due to the removal of edema.</p>

<p>At the young age of these effects may not occur at all, or to be mild, but after 40 years, when the body breaks down the balance of hormones, a change in metabolism, fluid accumulates more actively. Accordingly, massage is more effective way to reduce body weight. Of course, the effect of massage is very useful for the figure. But make no mistake, the fat remains in place, leaving only water.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, making the opposite action, a lot of people waiting to get on the output a result. Shaking the press, they are straining the abdominal muscles, hoping to lose weight. Visiting massage people relax the same muscle groups, waiting for an identical effect - weight loss. So what still needs to be done with the muscles? Perhaps, after all, cut, and as often as possible. If muscle relaxation accompanied by weight loss, people have lost weight during the holidays. To enhance the effect, he tried to muscle relaxants and antispasmodics - drugs that reduce muscle tone.</p>

<p>Lose weight with the help of belly massage can be in only one case: if you are doing it yourself. And preferably more than once per day. Massage takes away a lot of strength and energy, so you&rsquo;ll save calories, and with them - the extra weight. But lying on the table and making the masseur knead your stomach, you just get rid of the money that paid for his services. Of excess weight - is unlikely.</p>

<p><strong>Willpower and mood of success</strong> - your first allies in the difficult task to lose weight. There should be a clear desire to get rid of the extra kilos. Do not give up until you shake the ill-fated arrow on the mechanical balance in the smaller side, or until crawl down the numbers on the display of electronic scales.</p>

<p><strong>Learn to say a firm &quot;no&quot; to temptation</strong> and fast food, but, unfortunately, bad nutrition. Before you succumb to the temptation to buy a pizza, sugary sodas, delicious fries, a double burger with cheese or soft flour cakes, bathed in chocolate - think about the number of calories that are contained in them and imagine how they will be stored in the fat folds of your limp body.</p>

<p>Eat <strong>more foods with dietary fiber</strong>. They give food volume contribute to the rapid filling of the stomach and thus less food will cause a feeling of fullness in the brain.
