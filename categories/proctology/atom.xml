<h2>Why do I get hemorrhoids?</h2>

<p>Doctors say that lately hemorrhoids much &ldquo;younger&rdquo;. Most likely, the reason for that are the negative factors contributing to the development of the disease with which modern man often encountered. These factors include:</p>

<ul>
<li>pregnancy and childbirth;</li>
<li>heredity;</li>
<li>sedentary lifestyle;</li>
<li>unhealthy diet;</li>
<li>poor hygiene;</li>
<li>hypothermia;</li>
<li>chronic gastrointestinal disorder;</li>
<li>excessive exercise.</li>
</ul>


<p>The combination of these factors leads to the development of pathological enlargement of hemorrhoidal veins and implementation of disease. At the first symptoms should immediately contact a doctor, mainly because hemorrhoids characterized by chronic course with periodic exacerbations. In order to reduce the appearance of the disease and minimize the likelihood of an exacerbation, the patient must be aware of what not to do with hemorrhoids. Especially effective prevention of hemorrhoids is the first stage of the disease when the disease symptoms have not yet pronounced.</p>

<h2>Contraindications for hemorrhoids</h2>

<p><strong>Food contraindications</strong></p>

<p>When hemorrhoids diet is very important. As a preventive measure, doctors recommend eating foods containing large amounts of fiber. Such food will reduce the number of exacerbations and the severity of hemorrhoids. When varicose veins hemorrhoids may want to limit the consumption of these foods and dishes:</p>

<ul>
<li>fried foods;</li>
<li>hot and spicy dishes, irritating;</li>
<li>semolina;</li>
<li>mashed potatoes;</li>
<li>eggs;</li>
<li>jelly;</li>
<li>alcohol;</li>
<li>black tea, coffee.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Hypodynamy</strong></p>

<p>Sedentary lifestyle contributes to stagnation in the pelvic organs, which only aggravates the disease. At risk are people who have to be for a long time without moving (office workers, drivers). Try as much as possible to do a little workout. On the way to and from work, try to walk more. And best of all to engage in moderate exercise regularly.

<p>Literature data of recent years have pointed out that the cause of hemorrhoids is a violation of the outflow of blood from the venules of the cavernous bodies, which are located in the wall of the rectum (the largest cluster of notes on 3-7-11 hours on the dial) and is a substrate haemorrhoid. <!-- more -->Therefore, if the wall of the cavernous bodies, which is filled with blood directly from the arterial bed is damaged, the stands out of scarlet, oxygen saturation arterial blood.</p>

<p>Bleeding at internal hemorrhoids characterized in that the blood volume, wherein is of a few drops to 100-200 ml per day and with frequent hemorrhage causes the development of anemia. In some cases, hemorrhage may be inkjet and pulsating.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis.</strong> Under gentle disclosure of the edges of the anus hemorrhoids are defined as swollen formations bluish color, soft-elastic consistency, covered with a mucous membrane. Necessarily carry out the finger, mirroring studies and sigmoidoscopy. Soft hemorrhoids are rarely detected by digital examination, but this study is an important method for the differential diagnosis. When the mirror examination may reveal the bleeding internal hemorrhoids.</p>

<p><strong>Treatment.</strong> We must remember that the causes of intestinal bleeding may be tumors (benign and malignant) of rectum and colon. Only after exclusion of these diseases should begin to targeted treatment of hemorrhoidal bleeding.</p>

<p>In chronic hemorrhoids, which manifests itself only bleeding internal hemorrhoids without a loss of knots, in the absence of common anorectal thrombosis recommends a hemostatic therapy with Venapro. 10 percent calcium chloride, 5 percent solution of aminocaproic acid as well as with the use of adrenaline suppositories by recipe.</p>

<p>In the absence of contraindications is possible to use an injection of sclerosing agents.</p>

<p>Contraindications to this kind of treatment are diseases of the prostate and hypertension, in which if there is no severe anemia, such  bleeding is as would damping. At presence of infectious diseases, inflammatory changes in the walls of the anal canal and rectal mucosa injection of sclerosing agents is contraindicated. Relative contraindications for sclerotherapy are loss of internal hemorrhoids and frequent exacerbation of chronic hemorrhoids, because the presence of these complications are indications for surgical treatment.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://medusanews.com/images/thrombosed-hemorrhoid/image.jpg">http://medusanews.com/images/thrombosed-hemorrhoid/image.jpg</a>" width="200" height="150" title="&lsquo;Thrombosed hemorrhoid&rsquo; &lsquo;Thrombosis &ndash; Thrombosed hemorrhoid&rsquo;" > <strong>Thrombosed hemorrhoid</strong>, also called acute hemorrhoids &ndash; a disease which occurs in almost 10% of all adults. This is a problem that everyone knows, but prefer not to talk, because it&rsquo;s embarrassing. And meanwhile, it is the patients reluctance seeking medical attention leads to what the disease becomes chronic late stage.</p>

<p>The cause of the disease are blood clots of external or internal hemorrhoids that drop out. If you look, the blood clot is a hematoma near the anus, which brings a man a lot of inconvenience and pain.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Simultaneous thrombosis of external and internal nodes is fairly rare. It can spread to all anus around (in this case it is called the circular), or to be on only one side, covering the anus of a semicircle.</p>

<h2>Causes and symptoms of Thrombosed hemorrhoid</h2>

<p>Reasons for the formation of blood clots in hemorrhoids diverse. It can be physical exertion &ndash; weight lifting, pregnancy or childbirth, as well as diarrhea, constipation, hypothermia and even alcohol abuse. In addition, for unpleasant consequences can result sedentary lifestyle work-related (pilots and drivers), or some sports &ndash; weightlifting, cycling, horseback riding.</p>

<p>Any stress, leading to a rush of blood to the pelvis can cause rupture of the vessel in the perianal region and lead to thrombosed external hemorrhoid. In this case, the thrombus begins to put pressure on the vessel wall from within, irritating nerve endings and causing pain. It is these symptoms of hemorrhoids cause a &ldquo;duck&rdquo; gait of patients.</p>

<p>Most often in the early stages, the disease is accompanied by itching, burning and secretions from anus. Patients rarely turn to doctors with such complaints, because they consider them uncritical, or just shy of his problem. Most often they are accompanied by still bleeding. First, rare and meager &ndash; only a few drops during stool, and then they become regular. And when there is a prolapsed hemorrhoid and the pain becomes unbearable and avoid a visit to a specialist is can not.</p>

<h2>Thrombosed hemorrhoid treatment</h2>

<p>The easiest and fastest way to treat hemorrhoids &ndash; is surgery. It is performed under local anesthesia and takes only a few minutes. During the operation, the doctor-proctologist makes minimal incision (up to 5 mm) and through it removes the blood clot from the node, after which the pain immediately goes away. Sometimes, to achieve a cosmetic effect, thrombus excised together with the node. After these operations, the man does not lose the ability to work, and the wound is healing on-site intervention is less than a week.</p>

<p>The only drawback to this method is that the operation &ndash; not a radical cure for hemorrhoids. A blood clot will not appear on the site was operated, but could come close. Therefore, this method of treatment is used to advanced stages of the disease as a means of emergency medicine, as soon as possible to save people from pain.</p>

<p>In all other cases, and at the unwillingness of the patient subjected to surgery, treatment is carried out with the use of medication ointments, rectal suppositories and warm baths. This method gives the effect only after a month and in the future does not preclude the emergence of a blood clot in the same place. Therefore, in order to avoid undesirable effects during treatment should follow a diet, eliminating alcohol and spicy foods, as well as limit physical exertion and less walking.</p>

<p>Speaking of non-surgical treatment of hemorrhoids can not pay attention to the drug Venapro-Hemorrhoid Formula, which has proved its effectiveness in the fight against this disease. This drug is made from natural ingredients and with proper treatment recovery comes faster than with other drugs. It is particularly effective in the early stages of hemorrhoids when hemorrhoid nodes have not fallen out. Its also worth taking after recovery as prophylaxis to prevent any re-occurrence of a blood clot.</p>

<p>Remember, <strong>thrombosed hemorrhoid</strong> is always easier to cure in the early stages, and delayed treatment or lack of it at all can lead to complications.</p>

Asked to sit down on a chair, meet the &ldquo;thank you I&rsquo;ll stand by foot&rdquo;. Why is that? Because concerned about pain in the anal area, at whom are moderate, at whom expressed.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The cause of acute hemorrhoids is different: constipation, diarrhea, hypothermia, weight lifting, alcohol, pregnancy, childbirth, anal sex, etc. With an increase in intra-abdominal pressure occurs powerful rush of blood to pelvis, because of what could &ldquo;explode&rdquo; vein in the perianal area and formed <strong>thrombosed external hemorrhoid</strong>. In fact, this hematoma, which is located under the skin gives a lot of pain and discomfort. This occurs because blood clot presses on the inner tissues thereby stretching the nerve endings, followed by pain. Many people ask this hematoma can get to the heart? No description of a single case of getting thrombosed blood clot (hematoma) of the haemorrhoid in the heart.</p>

<p>Thrombosed external hemorrhoid is more often a unit, can occur immediately 2-3 thrombosed node and can be circular when the swells all perianal area. As well found thrombosis of internal hemorrhoids. This occurs against the background of already existing hemorrhoids during stool internal nodes drop out further as a consequence of the sphincter spasm nodes are infringed, there is an infringement of outflow of blood, swelling knotswith subsequent thrombosis. With such an aggravation of internal hemorrhoids pain for so many severe that patients can not &ldquo;neither sit nor stand up&rdquo; and some call the &ldquo;911&rdquo;. What to do if diagnosed acute hemorrhoids?</p>

<h2>How to treat thrombosed external hemorrhoid</h2>

<p>Treatment hemorrhoid thrombosis. Usually in such cases, you need to limit yourself to walking, exercise, spicy foods, alcohol. Appointed by warm baths and heating pads 2-3 times a day for 20-30 minutes (due to the heat accelerates the resorption of blood clots). When the external manifestations of thrombosis knots rectal suppositories are ineffective. The good effect of acute hemorrhoids gives a natural product such as «Venapro-Hemorrhoid Formula». Locally thrombosed knots must be lubricated with ointments Anusol HC, Carmol HC, Hydrocortisone, Hytone, Locoid Lipocream, Locoid, Westcort, that also helps to speed up the resorption process thrombosed clots. All the foregoing conservative therapy will surely give effect, it should be noted that in the conservative treatment process of resorption may take 1-1.5 months. After the complete disappearance of the phenomenon of acute hemorrhoids, on the site of the thrombosed knot almost always remains so-called fringe anal hemorrhoidal.It should be noted that in the future, at the same location, under the influence of any factor may again appear thrombosis node.</p>

<p>Now the information for those who do not like long to be treated. The most rapid and effective treatment of thrombosis, it is certainly a thrombectomy (forced removal of thrombus from the knot). Under anesthesia thrombosed clots are removed from the cut of up to 0.5 cm. Node decreases and the pain immediately stoped. The procedure takes about 1-2 minutes. At the site of thrombectomy wound remains (0.5 cm) that heals for an average of 4 days. In this case, the need for rectal suppositories, ointments, warm baths already not. However, it is recommended prophylactic course of Venapro-Hemorrhoid Formula (1 month). After 15 minutes of thrombectomy and recommendations of the patient to go home. Ability to work after the procedure is not lost. Frequently offer remove thrombosed clots together with the node in this case addition to the rapid relief of pain is achieved cosmetic effect. Already at this point there is no thrombotic conditions, but in other places around the circumference of the anus can appear. Why? Because thrombectomy and removal of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is not a radical operation.</p>

<p>In some cases, when exacerbation passes at available hemorrhoids II-IV stage, radical surgery is acceptable for time reasons. After this operation is a complete cure patients from hemorrhoidal disease and the appearance thrombosed external hemorrhoid of this place for many decades (may appear elsewhere). Risks and complications at radical surgery for time reasons do not exceed those for planned interventions.</p>
