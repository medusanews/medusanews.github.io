<p>Now the world specialists of hypertension and cardiovascular disease are unanimous: <strong>excess salt is detrimental to the overall population, regardless of age.</strong></p>

<p>Thus the reduction of salt is one of the leading objectives of national health nutrition.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The dangers of salt</h2>

<p>A strong link has been established between excessive salt intake and health.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A diet high in salt is one of the risk factors for hypertension and cardiovascular disease.</strong>
In fact, there is a direct link between excess salt in the diet and high blood pressure because the genes that control blood pressure are also those that regulate salt reabsorption in the kidneys. But cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in our country.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Excess salt is also known to promote the gastric cancer.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finally, too much salt increases the risk of osteoporosis.</strong>
Knowing that high salt levels in the blood increases calcium excretion in urine, after several years, this may result in a decrease in bone mineral density and increased osteoporosis.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The French consume too much salt</h2>

<p>According to the latest expertise of the National Agency for Food Safety (handles), the average salt consumption of French through food is 8.7 g/day in men and 6.7 g/day in women. At these intakes from food consumed, &ldquo;we must add 1 to 2 grams of salt per day, due to salting food and cooking water by the consumer himself&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>This is too much and too far from the recommendations of the WHO recommends not exceed 5 g of salt per day.</strong></p>

<p>So much so that health authorities have been forced to set interim target of 8 g per day maturity of 5 years, a reduction of 20% (6.5 g/day for women and children)!</p>

<h2>An imperative: reduce sodium intake in the diet</h2>

<p>Consumers generally know the risks associated with excess salt, but what they often do not know is that over 70% of the salt consumed comes from a group of 6 food:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bread and crackers.</li>
<li>The deli.</li>
<li>Soups.</li>
<li>Cheese.</li>
<li>The dishes.</li>
<li>Pizzas, quiches and savory pastries.</li>
</ul>


<p>To which must be added (because of their high consumption in children):</p>

<ul>
<li>The pastries.</li>
<li>The cereal breakfast.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Solutions they get there?</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Decrease the salt levels in foods and thus encourage industry to engage in a charter or regulatory changes.
Remember that salt is interesting as a preservative, flavor enhancer and has a assoiffant power (likely to drive up consumption of drinks&hellip;).</p></li>
<li><p>More information for consumers through the labeling of the salt content of industrial products.</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage French to limit their consumption of the most savory and salt additions in the preparation and during the meal.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>On the right track</strong>
These three fields of action have already been more or less established, with the first results in a decrease between 1999 and 2007 of 5.2% of average salt intake in the general population and 20-30% in very heavy users (more than 12 g/day).</p>

<h2>Delete eating habits at risk</h2>

<p><strong>We can all individually control a good part of our sodium intake by eliminating our eating habits at risk:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>No salt available on the table.</p></li>
<li><p>Ban systematic dusting: always taste before adding salt or salt.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace salt with other types of seasonings such as spices, herbs and cooking with garlic, onions, shallots.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce the amount of salt added to the cooking water.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace crackers, peanuts and chips with vegetables and fruits: cherry tomatoes, radish, melon balls, celery or carrots soaked in yoghurt sauce, etc..</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid too rich mineral waters by comparing the sodium salt contents on the labels.</p></li>
<li><p>Limiting industrial products, often very rich in salt.</p></li>
<li><p>Limit the richest salt foods: meats (salami, prosciutto), broth (vegetable or meat), sauces and condiments, cheeses, pizzas and quiches, pastries, crackers, etc..</p></li>
<li><p>Do not accustom young children to eat too salty because eating habits are set in early childhood and it is difficult to change in adulthood.</p></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/hysteria-what-symptoms-being-hysterical/0.jpg" width="200" height="150" title="&lsquo;hysteria, hysterical personality, hysterical conversion, hysterical somatization&rsquo; &lsquo;Hysteria: what symptoms? Being hysterical&rsquo;" >Hysteria, this term is often used in common parlance usually means in this context quite different things.</p>

<p>You are hysterical sometimes means: &ldquo;You get mad for nothing&rdquo;, &ldquo;You really added&rdquo; or &ldquo;I do not understand your operation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the term hysteria has a different meaning in psychiatric medicine that hysteria itself corresponds to the symptoms found in the foreground in a pathological personality type, hysterical personalities.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>How is a person suffering from hysteria?</h2>

<p>Specific attitudes of hysteria are being representing. When you see such a person, you feel that it is too: it seems to be in a movie, play a role; it dramatizes, dramatize, exaggerate, in add. It is in excess, talking loudly, quickly, occupies the ground, laughed too, makes great gestures, uses formulas disproportionate to what it says. Some TV presenters or some actors therefore logically hysterical personality.</p>

<p>Hysteria up to the mythomanie when the affected person really adds some too. It can go up lie, misrepresent reality. However hysteria does not always go to this extreme.</p>

<p>Another very common element in hysteria is seduction: human relationships are eroticized, we try to seduce you, in life in general, but also in the sexual realm. In humans, hysteria is often linked to philandering, a tendency to collect relationships. However, this seductive attitude is often associated with a poor sex, inhibited difficult. For hysteria is a facade that hides gaps.</p>

<h2>What are the thoughts related to hysteria?</h2>

<p>The hysterical behavior and therefore hysterical symptoms, are exposed because they are caused by inner thoughts. In other words, a person with hysterical tendencies thoughts explaining his behavior.</p>

<p>It may be varied cognition:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be the center of attention&rdquo;;
&ldquo;I need you to notice me&rdquo;;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to be alone&rdquo;;
&ldquo;I need to charm, to please&rdquo;;
&ldquo;I do not want you see my weaknesses, my fears&rdquo;;
&ldquo;I need the others because I do not know just do it myself&rdquo;;
&ldquo;I want you to find me irresistible&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<h2>The deep emotions of hysteria</h2>

<p>If signs of hysteria are related to thoughts, these thoughts are related, deeper emotions. These emotions are especially fears that seek to be erased by the hysterical behavior:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you do not love me&hellip; So I&rsquo;m doing what I think suitable for you love me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I do not exist&hellip; So I do everything for you notice me and feel me exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can not do it myself&hellip; So I need to charm around me that are helping me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to be unhappy face myself&hellip; So I&rsquo;m dizzy from others, so do not find me alone with myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that my weaknesses are noticed&hellip; Then I add, I boast, I invent, I overplayed to try to hide my limits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Overall, the hysterical symptoms, fairly simple to spot, and sometimes annoying for the environment actually correspond to deep fears and significant gaps. Perhaps by being aware, we can all show more empathy for people working in this register.</p>

<p>Recall that cholesterol is accompanied at first no symptoms until the day cardiovascular complications occur (myocardial infarction, stroke)!</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>At what times of life should you calibrate their cholesterol?</h2>

<h3>A adolescence</h3>

<p>A first cholesterol test is recommended between 16 and 30 years. Some people are more at risk than others and our lifestyle plays an important role, explaining that high cholesterol can occur in childhood. But during this period of life, the &ldquo;bad cholesterol&rdquo; is gradually deposited on the arterial walls and turns into plaque at the end of adolescence. In addition, it is to the age of 18 that cholesterol binds permanently.</p>

<blockquote><p>In other words, if cholesterol is high in adolescence, it will be a lifetime.</p></blockquote>

<h3>From 45 years for men and 55 years for women</h3>

<p>From these ages, a cholesterol test is recommended every 3 years. Is that with advancing age, the risk of having too much cholesterol in the blood is increased.</p>

<blockquote><p>As is also the case for other cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, physical inactivity, overweight&hellip;), it must be particularly vigilant.</p></blockquote>

<h3>At the time of menopause</h3>

<p>In women, a dosage once installed menopause is wise. Indeed, major hormonal changes that occur at this time of life can lead to a significant increase in cholesterol.</p>

<blockquote><p>Menopause is a key period to make a determination of its cholesterol.</p></blockquote>

<h2>What are the diseases that require close monitoring cholesterol?</h2>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>type 2 diabetes</strong> imposes a cholesterol test every year.</li>
<li><strong>Overweight or obesity promoting cholesterol</strong>, it is necessary to conduct regular dosages. This is also the case when the waist is high: greater than 88 cm for women and 102 cm for men.</li>
<li><strong>Some diseases such as chronic renal failure and untreated hypothyroidism cause high cholesterol</strong> and impose specific monitoring.</li>
<li>Finally, <strong>some drugs affect blood lipids</strong>. Talk to your doctor.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What are the habits that require regular cholesterol test?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Smoking (or stopped for less than 3 years), especially if combined with an oral contraceptive.</li>
<li>Inactivity.</li>
<li>A diet rich in meat, animal products and fats.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What dose do we exactly?</h2>

<p>The determination of total cholesterol in the blood is commonly prescribed as part of a screening or surveillance.</p>

<p>However, to get a clearer picture, it is necessary to make an assessment of lipid abnormalities, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Triglyceride and HDL- cholesterol</strong> (normal: From 0.35 to 0.75 g/l).</li>
<li><strong>On the LDL-cholesterol</strong> is calculated from the values ??of the previous (normal: 1 to 1.6 g/l).</li>

The disease occurs quite often, and do not always get sick elderly people (although they are certainly more often).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Arthritis &ndash; a set of measures, including medication, mud hirudotherapy, physiotherapy, and, alas, sometimes it comes to surgery. But the disease could have been avoided or at least significantly delay it, if in time, that is, from his youth to think about its prevention. And this, above all, the right diet. But never too late to start, the people who have been diagnosed with arthritis, it is recommended to stick to a certain diet &ndash; in conjunction with the main treatment this will substantially reduce joint pain and slow the progression of the disease.</p>

<h2>Fighting overweight</h2>

<p>There have arthritis your &ldquo;favorites&rdquo;, but rather &ldquo;darling&rdquo; &ndash; is obese women overstepped 50-year milestone. As a rule, most of these ladies are suffering from any disease of the joints &ndash; this arthritis and osteoarthritis and gout, etc. It is important to understand that the further progression of these diseases in a short time can lead to disability and, of course, very spoil the quality of life, and that is why it is now important in combination with other therapeutic measures to think about weight loss. This not only helps to improve the condition of the joints, but also contribute to the overall improvement of the body.</p>

<h2>Priority products</h2>

<p>Is not a secret that vegetarians are significantly less likely to suffer from diseases of the joints than avid meat-eaters. Besides diet, based fresh fruits and vegetables containing fiber, promote rapid weight loss.</p>

<p>For example, people suffering from arthritis, recommended in all kinds of cabbage. It contains sulforaphane &ndash; a substance which prevents the destruction of the cartilage tissue. In this sense, all the good cabbage varieties, but especially broccoli. Cabbage also contains a record number of vitamins, micro and macro, and therefore not only helps prevent joint pain, but also enhances the body&rsquo;s resistance to many diseases. And by the way, the constant use of cabbage effectively helps to cope with the problem of constipation, if any.</p>

<p>Summer must eat cherries. These berries contain a lot of antioxidants (anthocyanins), which due to their anti-inflammatory properties, act as an anesthetic. Arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout even able to retreat before the cherries.</p>

<p><strong>Collagen</strong> is essential for building bone and cartilage, muscles and ligaments. He is in aspic jelly or which are prepared on the basis of bone broth.</p>

<p><strong>Chondroprotectors</strong> &ndash; another substance which promotes the restoration of the cartilaginous tissue and enhances the production of synovial fluid.

<p>One of the causes of joint diseases is metabolic disorders, so patients with arthritis need fats. It should be fats of vegetable origin, also allowed a small amount of butter.</p>

<p>Body needs B vitamins &ndash; they play an important role in the proper metabolism. A lack of these vitamins in addition to arthritis can appear many other diseases, is caused by impaired metabolism.</p>

<p>Vitamin D &ndash; is another important vitamin, its deficiency leads to excessive deposition of calcium in the articular cartilage to reduce its elasticity. Result &ndash; the cartilage is gradually destroyed. Compensate for the deficiency of this vitamin helps the fish oil &ndash; it requires not only children but also adults.</p>

<p>Drink a lot! Water &ndash; the basis of any diet in the treatment of arthritis. Dehydration is extremely harmful for our joints, and, as they say, do not lead to sin, it is understood that dehydration occurs in the joints long before a person starts to feel thirsty. But the fluid can not be abused &ndash; excess fluid leads to edema, and this disrupts the blood supply and food joints. So drink plenty of fluids, but be careful to avoid edema.</p>

    <link href="http://medusanews.com/articles/meals-centenarians-secrets-of-longevity/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-28T23:12:00+06:00</updated>
    <id>http://medusanews.com/articles/meals-centenarians-secrets-of-longevity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://medusanews.com/images/food-centenarians/image.jpg">http://medusanews.com/images/food-centenarians/image.jpg</a>" width="200" height="150" title="&lsquo;Food centenarians, longevity secrets&rsquo; &lsquo;Meals centenarians. Secrets of longevity&rsquo;" > Secrets of centenarians &ndash; in their diet. The greatest Greek physician Hippocrates and teacher, whose name is in our perception is inextricably linked with the famous Hippocratic Oath, rightly considered the &ldquo;father of medicine&rdquo;, claimed that any human disease is due to a breach of food habits and lifestyle.</p>

<p>It belongs to Hippocrates famous phrase: &ldquo;We are what we eat&rdquo;, thus emphasizing the most important role nutrition for human life and health.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Without exception, all people want to live a long time, but have to stay healthy, vigorous, firm in the mind and memory. Scientists around the world are trying to find the answer to the secrets of longevity, carefully study this phenomenon, trying to understand why so few people manage to live so long without the disease, although genetically the human capacity for approximately 150 years of life.</p>

<h2>Power centenarians</h2>

<p>Despite the huge number of hypotheses about the secrets of health and longevity, as well as the fact that all the various centenarians living conditions &ndash; climatic, geographical, social, and views of all scientists in agreement that the power of centenarians is very closely linked with longevity and plays it  For all their differences and peculiarities, long-lived of all regions of the Earth have very similar features and rules for the use of food.</p>

<p>Slightly paraphrasing the famous line of Hippocrates, you can add that person &ndash; it&rsquo;s not only what he eats, but also the fact that he was drinking. All the world&rsquo;s centenarians drink only pure, natural spring water, which is the most important secret of longevity, since the human body is 75% water and therefore it is very important what kind of water it makes its internal reserves. On the crucial role of water in human life, norms of consumption and correct drinking regime for health read the article on our website.</p>

<p>Secrets of centenarians is pretty simple, like all brilliant. Centenarians world eat only those foods that grow in their climate zone without using anything to eat imported and exotic. It is so right that we should consider whether we need, such as bananas, which, undoubtedly, are a storehouse of vitamins, but only if they break and then eat.</p>

<p>However, as is known, bananas have not grow, they rip green, immature and thus are coated with wax and other harmful chemical compounds for prolonged preservation and transportation. So I ask, we need such fruits is not it better to eat an apple? The same question arises about the imported strawberries and watermelons have no taste, no smell, no good. Is not it better to wait for the season to gorge and plenty of delicious and healthy fruits and vegetables that grow in our area?</p>

<p>All centenarians eat very little of the world, never overeat and get up from the table without a sense of satiety. They are no excess weight and obesity, which are known to not add health and longevity. About the dangers of overeating and benefits of short breaks from eating to read this article.</p>

<p>Food in the diet dominated by long-lived low-fat and low-fat, which is very useful for keeping in perfect condition of blood vessels and the prevention of hypertension. The use of low-calorie food that has high biological activity, has long been experimentally proved by many scientists. Well known scientific experiment conducted on rats &ndash; in a subgroup of animals that reduced caloric intake by a quarter, life expectancy increased by 32%. However, where calorie reduced by 50%, the rats lived twice as long.</p>

<p>Food centenarians consume only fresh, it keeps the most of the vitamins and nutrients of food. Naturally, they reject the canned food and other unhealthy foods. No fast food, reheating and yesterday&rsquo;s food out of the fridge, all the half-eaten give cattle.</p>

<p>By the way, according to some studies, this indispensable in the modern kitchen thing as a microwave, just destroys the products have passed the microwave treatment, vitamins, minerals and nutrients. Therefore, whenever possible, should follow the example of centenarians &ndash; cook gruel and then eat it, not a three-day warm up in the microwave soup, which does not have anything useful. Especially do not recommend to warm up food in the microwave for small children.</p>

<p>Power centenarians virtually includes entrees and rich broth and meat on their menu is mainly present in cooked form. On the table there is always a lot of different herbs that help to keep the gut flora in perfect condition. In centenarians Abkhazia and Azerbaijan on the composition of intestinal microflora in general identical to the flora of healthy children, which is achieved by regular consumption of the national dairy products, which are known to be very useful for proper digestion.</p>

<p>An important secret of longevity is also made in the absence of sugar in their diet in its purest form, as well as a variety of jams, chocolates and other sweets today that can trigger the development of diabetes. Sugar they receive in the form of glucose, which is necessary for the body to quickly replenish energy deficit by eating honey, raisins and a variety of sweet fruit. Fruits and vegetables make up a large portion of all food centenarians.</p>

<p>Chinese gerontologists are absolutely sure that the formula found longevity and looks like this &ndash; very low calorie diet, with a minimal amount of fat and animal protein and lots of vegetables and fruits.</p>

<p>As far as this is true, time will tell, but do for yourself useful conclusions and adopt some simple secrets of centenarians in the diet, we just have to. Having started eating right, as do the long-lived all over the world, we will stop gaining weight, get sick, we are in great shape and, therefore, will live longer.</p>
