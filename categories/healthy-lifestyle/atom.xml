    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/hysteria-what-symptoms-being-hysterical/0.jpg" width="200" height="150" title="&lsquo;hysteria, hysterical personality, hysterical conversion, hysterical somatization&rsquo; &lsquo;Hysteria: what symptoms? Being hysterical&rsquo;" >Hysteria, this term is often used in common parlance usually means in this context quite different things.</p>

<p>You are hysterical sometimes means: &ldquo;You get mad for nothing&rdquo;, &ldquo;You really added&rdquo; or &ldquo;I do not understand your operation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the term hysteria has a different meaning in psychiatric medicine that hysteria itself corresponds to the symptoms found in the foreground in a pathological personality type, hysterical personalities.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>How is a person suffering from hysteria?</h2>

<p>Specific attitudes of hysteria are being representing. When you see such a person, you feel that it is too: it seems to be in a movie, play a role; it dramatizes, dramatize, exaggerate, in add. It is in excess, talking loudly, quickly, occupies the ground, laughed too, makes great gestures, uses formulas disproportionate to what it says. Some TV presenters or some actors therefore logically hysterical personality.</p>

<p>Hysteria up to the mythomanie when the affected person really adds some too. It can go up lie, misrepresent reality. However hysteria does not always go to this extreme.</p>

<p>Another very common element in hysteria is seduction: human relationships are eroticized, we try to seduce you, in life in general, but also in the sexual realm. In humans, hysteria is often linked to philandering, a tendency to collect relationships. However, this seductive attitude is often associated with a poor sex, inhibited difficult. For hysteria is a facade that hides gaps.</p>

<h2>What are the thoughts related to hysteria?</h2>

<p>The hysterical behavior and therefore hysterical symptoms, are exposed because they are caused by inner thoughts. In other words, a person with hysterical tendencies thoughts explaining his behavior.</p>

<p>It may be varied cognition:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be the center of attention&rdquo;;
&ldquo;I need you to notice me&rdquo;;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to be alone&rdquo;;
&ldquo;I need to charm, to please&rdquo;;
&ldquo;I do not want you see my weaknesses, my fears&rdquo;;
&ldquo;I need the others because I do not know just do it myself&rdquo;;
&ldquo;I want you to find me irresistible&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<h2>The deep emotions of hysteria</h2>

<p>If signs of hysteria are related to thoughts, these thoughts are related, deeper emotions. These emotions are especially fears that seek to be erased by the hysterical behavior:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you do not love me&hellip; So I&rsquo;m doing what I think suitable for you love me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I do not exist&hellip; So I do everything for you notice me and feel me exist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can not do it myself&hellip; So I need to charm around me that are helping me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to be unhappy face myself&hellip; So I&rsquo;m dizzy from others, so do not find me alone with myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that my weaknesses are noticed&hellip; Then I add, I boast, I invent, I overplayed to try to hide my limits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Overall, the hysterical symptoms, fairly simple to spot, and sometimes annoying for the environment actually correspond to deep fears and significant gaps. Perhaps by being aware, we can all show more empathy for people working in this register.</p>

<p>Recall that cholesterol is accompanied at first no symptoms until the day cardiovascular complications occur (myocardial infarction, stroke)!</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>At what times of life should you calibrate their cholesterol?</h2>

<h3>A adolescence</h3>

<p>A first cholesterol test is recommended between 16 and 30 years. Some people are more at risk than others and our lifestyle plays an important role, explaining that high cholesterol can occur in childhood. But during this period of life, the &ldquo;bad cholesterol&rdquo; is gradually deposited on the arterial walls and turns into plaque at the end of adolescence. In addition, it is to the age of 18 that cholesterol binds permanently.</p>

<blockquote><p>In other words, if cholesterol is high in adolescence, it will be a lifetime.</p></blockquote>

<h3>From 45 years for men and 55 years for women</h3>

<p>From these ages, a cholesterol test is recommended every 3 years. Is that with advancing age, the risk of having too much cholesterol in the blood is increased.</p>

<blockquote><p>As is also the case for other cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, physical inactivity, overweight&hellip;), it must be particularly vigilant.</p></blockquote>

<h3>At the time of menopause</h3>

<p>In women, a dosage once installed menopause is wise. Indeed, major hormonal changes that occur at this time of life can lead to a significant increase in cholesterol.</p>

<blockquote><p>Menopause is a key period to make a determination of its cholesterol.</p></blockquote>

<h2>What are the diseases that require close monitoring cholesterol?</h2>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>type 2 diabetes</strong> imposes a cholesterol test every year.</li>
<li><strong>Overweight or obesity promoting cholesterol</strong>, it is necessary to conduct regular dosages. This is also the case when the waist is high: greater than 88 cm for women and 102 cm for men.</li>
<li><strong>Some diseases such as chronic renal failure and untreated hypothyroidism cause high cholesterol</strong> and impose specific monitoring.</li>
<li>Finally, <strong>some drugs affect blood lipids</strong>. Talk to your doctor.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What are the habits that require regular cholesterol test?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Smoking (or stopped for less than 3 years), especially if combined with an oral contraceptive.</li>
<li>Inactivity.</li>
<li>A diet rich in meat, animal products and fats.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What dose do we exactly?</h2>

<p>The determination of total cholesterol in the blood is commonly prescribed as part of a screening or surveillance.</p>

<p>However, to get a clearer picture, it is necessary to make an assessment of lipid abnormalities, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Triglyceride and HDL- cholesterol</strong> (normal: From 0.35 to 0.75 g/l).</li>
<li><strong>On the LDL-cholesterol</strong> is calculated from the values ??of the previous (normal: 1 to 1.6 g/l).</li>

The disease occurs quite often, and do not always get sick elderly people (although they are certainly more often).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Arthritis &ndash; a set of measures, including medication, mud hirudotherapy, physiotherapy, and, alas, sometimes it comes to surgery. But the disease could have been avoided or at least significantly delay it, if in time, that is, from his youth to think about its prevention. And this, above all, the right diet. But never too late to start, the people who have been diagnosed with arthritis, it is recommended to stick to a certain diet &ndash; in conjunction with the main treatment this will substantially reduce joint pain and slow the progression of the disease.</p>

<h2>Fighting overweight</h2>

<p>There have arthritis your &ldquo;favorites&rdquo;, but rather &ldquo;darling&rdquo; &ndash; is obese women overstepped 50-year milestone. As a rule, most of these ladies are suffering from any disease of the joints &ndash; this arthritis and osteoarthritis and gout, etc. It is important to understand that the further progression of these diseases in a short time can lead to disability and, of course, very spoil the quality of life, and that is why it is now important in combination with other therapeutic measures to think about weight loss. This not only helps to improve the condition of the joints, but also contribute to the overall improvement of the body.</p>

<h2>Priority products</h2>

<p>Is not a secret that vegetarians are significantly less likely to suffer from diseases of the joints than avid meat-eaters. Besides diet, based fresh fruits and vegetables containing fiber, promote rapid weight loss.</p>

<p>For example, people suffering from arthritis, recommended in all kinds of cabbage. It contains sulforaphane &ndash; a substance which prevents the destruction of the cartilage tissue. In this sense, all the good cabbage varieties, but especially broccoli. Cabbage also contains a record number of vitamins, micro and macro, and therefore not only helps prevent joint pain, but also enhances the body&rsquo;s resistance to many diseases. And by the way, the constant use of cabbage effectively helps to cope with the problem of constipation, if any.</p>

<p>Summer must eat cherries. These berries contain a lot of antioxidants (anthocyanins), which due to their anti-inflammatory properties, act as an anesthetic. Arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout even able to retreat before the cherries.</p>

<p><strong>Collagen</strong> is essential for building bone and cartilage, muscles and ligaments. He is in aspic jelly or which are prepared on the basis of bone broth.</p>

<p><strong>Chondroprotectors</strong> &ndash; another substance which promotes the restoration of the cartilaginous tissue and enhances the production of synovial fluid. Pharmacopeia offers a variety of drugs for the treatment of arthritis, based on glucosamine and chondroitin them who belong to the group chondroprotectors. Contains a substance in food gelatin, so do not forget to prepare a more delicious dessert and low-cal like jelly.</p>

<p>It must be treated gently <strong>proteins</strong>, such as red meat is recommended to exclude completely, but that does not mean that you should go to the protein-free diet. Proteins are needed to build new tissue and to restore the cartilage that covers the articular surfaces of bones. &ldquo;Take&rdquo; protein from lean white meat, fish and vegetable of buckwheat and legumes (peas, beans, lentils). By the way, the protein is better absorbed if the meat is cooked for a couple of stewed or boiled. Contribute to the restoration of the joints and dairy products, particularly useful dairy products &ndash; yogurt, fermented baked milk, cottage cheese.</p>

<p>One of the causes of joint diseases is metabolic disorders, so patients with arthritis need fats. It should be fats of vegetable origin, also allowed a small amount of butter.</p>

<p>Body needs B vitamins &ndash; they play an important role in the proper metabolism. A lack of these vitamins in addition to arthritis can appear many other diseases, is caused by impaired metabolism.</p>

<p>Vitamin D &ndash; is another important vitamin, its deficiency leads to excessive deposition of calcium in the articular cartilage to reduce its elasticity. Result &ndash; the cartilage is gradually destroyed. Compensate for the deficiency of this vitamin helps the fish oil &ndash; it requires not only children but also adults.</p>

<p>Drink a lot! Water &ndash; the basis of any diet in the treatment of arthritis. Dehydration is extremely harmful for our joints, and, as they say, do not lead to sin, it is understood that dehydration occurs in the joints long before a person starts to feel thirsty. But the fluid can not be abused &ndash; excess fluid leads to edema, and this disrupts the blood supply and food joints. So drink plenty of fluids, but be careful to avoid edema.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://medusanews.com/images/food-centenarians/image.jpg">http://medusanews.com/images/food-centenarians/image.jpg</a>" width="200" height="150" title="&lsquo;Food centenarians, longevity secrets&rsquo; &lsquo;Meals centenarians. Secrets of longevity&rsquo;" > Secrets of centenarians &ndash; in their diet. The greatest Greek physician Hippocrates and teacher, whose name is in our perception is inextricably linked with the famous Hippocratic Oath, rightly considered the &ldquo;father of medicine&rdquo;, claimed that any human disease is due to a breach of food habits and lifestyle.</p>

<p>It belongs to Hippocrates famous phrase: &ldquo;We are what we eat&rdquo;, thus emphasizing the most important role nutrition for human life and health.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Without exception, all people want to live a long time, but have to stay healthy, vigorous, firm in the mind and memory. Scientists around the world are trying to find the answer to the secrets of longevity, carefully study this phenomenon, trying to understand why so few people manage to live so long without the disease, although genetically the human capacity for approximately 150 years of life.</p>

<h2>Power centenarians</h2>

<p>Despite the huge number of hypotheses about the secrets of health and longevity, as well as the fact that all the various centenarians living conditions &ndash; climatic, geographical, social, and views of all scientists in agreement that the power of centenarians is very closely linked with longevity and plays it  For all their differences and peculiarities, long-lived of all regions of the Earth have very similar features and rules for the use of food.</p>

<p>Slightly paraphrasing the famous line of Hippocrates, you can add that person &ndash; it&rsquo;s not only what he eats, but also the fact that he was drinking. All the world&rsquo;s centenarians drink only pure, natural spring water, which is the most important secret of longevity, since the human body is 75% water and therefore it is very important what kind of water it makes its internal reserves. On the crucial role of water in human life, norms of consumption and correct drinking regime for health read the article on our website.</p>

<p>Secrets of centenarians is pretty simple, like all brilliant. Centenarians world eat only those foods that grow in their climate zone without using anything to eat imported and exotic. It is so right that we should consider whether we need, such as bananas, which, undoubtedly, are a storehouse of vitamins, but only if they break and then eat.</p>

<p>However, as is known, bananas have not grow, they rip green, immature and thus are coated with wax and other harmful chemical compounds for prolonged preservation and transportation. So I ask, we need such fruits is not it better to eat an apple? The same question arises about the imported strawberries and watermelons have no taste, no smell, no good. Is not it better to wait for the season to gorge and plenty of delicious and healthy fruits and vegetables that grow in our area?</p>

<p>All centenarians eat very little of the world, never overeat and get up from the table without a sense of satiety. They are no excess weight and obesity, which are known to not add health and longevity. About the dangers of overeating and benefits of short breaks from eating to read this article.</p>

<p>Food in the diet dominated by long-lived low-fat and low-fat, which is very useful for keeping in perfect condition of blood vessels and the prevention of hypertension. The use of low-calorie food that has high biological activity, has long been experimentally proved by many scientists. Well known scientific experiment conducted on rats &ndash; in a subgroup of animals that reduced caloric intake by a quarter, life expectancy increased by 32%. However, where calorie reduced by 50%, the rats lived twice as long.</p>

<p>Food centenarians consume only fresh, it keeps the most of the vitamins and nutrients of food. Naturally, they reject the canned food and other unhealthy foods. No fast food, reheating and yesterday&rsquo;s food out of the fridge, all the half-eaten give cattle.</p>

<p>By the way, according to some studies, this indispensable in the modern kitchen thing as a microwave, just destroys the products have passed the microwave treatment, vitamins, minerals and nutrients. Therefore, whenever possible, should follow the example of centenarians &ndash; cook gruel and then eat it, not a three-day warm up in the microwave soup, which does not have anything useful. Especially do not recommend to warm up food in the microwave for small children.</p>

<p>Power centenarians virtually includes entrees and rich broth and meat on their menu is mainly present in cooked form. On the table there is always a lot of different herbs that help to keep the gut flora in perfect condition. In centenarians Abkhazia and Azerbaijan on the composition of intestinal microflora in general identical to the flora of healthy children, which is achieved by regular consumption of the national dairy products, which are known to be very useful for proper digestion.</p>

<p>An important secret of longevity is also made in the absence of sugar in their diet in its purest form, as well as a variety of jams, chocolates and other sweets today that can trigger the development of diabetes. Sugar they receive in the form of glucose, which is necessary for the body to quickly replenish energy deficit by eating honey, raisins and a variety of sweet fruit. Fruits and vegetables make up a large portion of all food centenarians.</p>

<p>Chinese gerontologists are absolutely sure that the formula found longevity and looks like this &ndash; very low calorie diet, with a minimal amount of fat and animal protein and lots of vegetables and fruits.</p>

<p>As far as this is true, time will tell, but do for yourself useful conclusions and adopt some simple secrets of centenarians in the diet, we just have to. Having started eating right, as do the long-lived all over the world, we will stop gaining weight, get sick, we are in great shape and, therefore, will live longer.</p>

    <updated>2013-11-28T23:10:00+06:00</updated>
    <id>http://medusanews.com/articles/periodontal-disease-and-bleeding-gums</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://medusanews.com/images/periodontal-disease/image.jpg">http://medusanews.com/images/periodontal-disease/image.jpg</a>" width="200" height="150" title="&lsquo;Periodontal disease, bleeding gums, periodontal&rsquo; &lsquo;Periodontal disease and bleeding gums&rsquo;" > Successful treatment of periodontal disease depends on timely access to a doctor. Bleeding gums is the most common symptom of periodontal disease &ndash; a complex of tissues surrounding and holding the teeth in the jaw bone. Despite the fact that by Parodont also include bone around the teeth and muscle ligaments that hold the teeth in the jaw bones, most people are faced with the problem of gum &ndash; regular or occasional bleeding, swelling and inflammation.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Many people mistakenly believe trifling periodontal disease and do not require emergency treatment of symptomatic &ndash; with &ldquo;harmless&rdquo; bleeding gums simply rinse their mouth herbs and do not go to the doctor. However, engaging in self-treatment, they cause serious damage to your health.</p>

<p>Fact that gingivitis (initial stage of periodontitis), the main symptom is bleeding gums, quite successfully (nearly 100%) is treatable if it initiated when the first symptoms.</p>

<p>If the disease takes the form of running, then there is a risk of losing teeth even at a young age. According to the WHO, 80% of children under the age of 10 years, there are already early signs of gingivitis, which is associated with significant physiological stress of the periodontal tissues in a growing body when cutting, shaping and growth of teeth.</p>

<p>For older people, because they have periodontitis tooth loss occurs in 95% of cases. However, there is good news &ndash; if only a few decades ago with the disease periodontitis keep the teeth was considered virtually impossible, the modern development of zubosohranyayuschih technology to successfully stop the destructive process.</p>

<h2>What is periodontal disease and periodontal disease &ndash; what&rsquo;s the difference between them</h2>

<p>Periodontal disease is a relatively rare disease (it accounts for only about 3 &ndash; 4% of the cases of periodontal problems), while periodontitis is &ldquo;honorable&rdquo; second among all dental disease (caries immediately after), and is present to varying degrees in nearly 95.</p>

<h2>Periodontal disease causes and symptoms</h2>

<p>Periodontal disease &ndash; is a non-inflammatory disease of periodontal tissues, which are due to internal disturbances in the body, leading to malnutrition and periodontal tissue perfusion and, as a consequence, to atrophy of the alveolar bone (bone edges of the hole tooth).</p>

<p>As a result of atrophic processes in periodontitis occur sclerotic changes in the bone tissue, reduced interdental septum, and the gums gradually become thinner and the like &ldquo;settle down&rdquo;, resulting in the effect of &ldquo;wedge-shaped teeth&rdquo; with bare roots. In the future, increased sensitivity to chemical and thermal stimuli, changing the color and the enamel is destroyed. Subsequently, as a result of running and complete atrophy, the teeth become loose and fall out much.</p>

<p>Local factors, in particular the impact of micro-organisms essential role in the development of the disease do not play, but serve only unfavorable factor aggravating.</p>

<h2>Periodontal disease symptoms and the stage</h2>

<p>Periodontitis, in contrast to periodontal disease, is an inflammatory nature and manifests the destruction of the connection between the tooth, gum and surrounding tissues, the formation of deep periodontal pockets and the gradual deformation and destruction of the bone hole tooth.</p>

<p>Because periodontal disease most often develops slowly and gradually over the years does not cause discomfort in the early stages it is quite difficult to diagnose. However, it should be noted that there are cases sufficient and rapid development of the disease.</p>

<h2>Step periodontitis</h2>

<p>First, the easy, harmless and effectively treatable stage of periodontal disease (gingivitis) is accompanied by a slight redness, inflammation and bleeding gums, bad breath and the formation of shallow periodontal pockets.</p>

<p>While moderate adds the following symptoms &ndash; a small tooth mobility, the emergence of cracks and gaps between the teeth, on education-and subgingival stones, difficulty in chewing food, deepening periodontal pockets (up to 5 mm) with a small selection of them.</p>

<p>In severe teeth start to hurt badly, offset, in part, loose and fall out, and deepened periodontal pockets and from their cavities are frequent and copious purulent discharge with an unpleasant odor.</p>

<p>Causes periodontal disease are diverse and the main of them are traditionally considered to be a lack of oral hygiene, however, all is not as easy as it might seem. Indeed, the microbes that live in the mouth and form plaque (stones), can affect the periodontal tissues, they cause inflammation and lead to loosening and loss of teeth. Therefore, periodic professional scaling is necessary, but, unfortunately, the lack of means of prevention.</p>

<p>Equally important role in the development of pathology plays the uneven load on the teeth, malocclusion uncorrected, errors prosthetics and jaw injuries. For example, periodontal disease often develops if removed 6th teeth and dentures soon not installed or improperly formed contact between the upper and lower jaws. Adverse effect might wear braces, microtrauma while cutting the thread, the habit of chewing on one side, leading to an overload of a separate part of the jaw, use as toothpicks metal objects, the effect on enamel acid and alkali.</p>

<p>It is important that the seals were installed correctly &ndash; do not protrude over the edge of the tooth, and at the same time, a close fit to it. If the seal is not tight fits, the germs and infections can easily penetrate to the root and destroy it, but if the seal hangs, it prevents the removal of plaque quality, and as a consequence, inflammation of the gum tissue. In case of improper prosthetic disease process develops locally, ie, only in problem areas. In such cases we say about the local gingivitis or periodontitis local.</p>

<p>In addition, the trigger for the development of the disease often appear overall negative factors for the entire body &ndash; lowered immunity, salivary gland diseases, endocrine diseases and malnutrition. In this case, the pathological process is developing in the area of ​​the teeth and is of a generalized (universal) the nature &ndash; of a generalized gingivitis or periodontitis.</p>

<h2>Periodontitis treatment</h2>

<p>Treatment of periodontal disease in the early stages, as mentioned, has a very good prognosis, so it is very important at the first warning signs, consult a dentist. First of all, you should alert the occurrence of bleeding when brushing your teeth and chewing hard food.</p>

<p>First, try replacing your toothbrush at a softer and more use toothpaste and mouthwash with the addition of healing, restorative and antiseptic natural components. If this does not lead to the desired result, you should immediately seek medical attention &ndash; periodontist, as the bleeding can not be ignored.</p>

<p>In the first phase treatment is limited, as a rule, professional cleaning and removal of plaque and use of folk remedies for periodontal disease &ndash; applications of aloe leaves and rinse with infusions and decoctions of medicinal herbs (chamomile, oak bark, sage, plantain). Traditional medicine with bleeding gums are also advised to rub them with sea salt, honey &ndash; Mix 20 g of honey with 5 &ndash; 10 g salt and rub the teeth and gums every day, not leading to injury.</p>

<p>In addition, the presence of periodontal pockets doctor offers them washing with antiseptic solutions &ndash; a process that helps reduce inflammation and swelling of the gums and reduce bleeding. If the teeth lose their stability, showed a temporary or permanent splinting especially strong ribbons &ndash; first on the tooth surfaces make the groove depth of about 0.5 mm, and then placed her in the tape and cover the filling material.</p>

<p>To gain stability, and widely used surgical techniques, in particular patchwork technique, transplantation of bone and soft tissues and artificial guided bone regeneration. Flap operation applies to the case where the gingival pocket too deep (greater than 5 mm) to reduce its depth. To do this, a small incision is made in the gum area and cleared of stones baring at the root. Then align the affected contour of bone and sutured incision.</p>

<p>Transplantation of soft tissue (taken from the sky) is applied at the tooth roots and bared for cosmetic purposes, and bone transplants (of their own bone or synthetic) used in significant destruction of the bone tissue for retaining the tooth, and for regeneration of new bone tissue.</p>

<h3>Treatment of periodontal disease</h3>

<p>Despite the fact that an effective treatment of periodontal disease is currently no exist as physiotherapy and surgical modern technology to recover gums and relieve itching, pain, hypersensitivity and other unpleasant symptoms.</p>

<p>Physical therapy aimed at improving blood circulation and regeneration processes in the periodontium. These include massage gums darsonvalization, vakuumoterapiya, flyuktuorizatsiya, gingival shower, UHF and magnetic-laser therapy. A good massage for the gums and the best prevention of periodontal disease is the chewing of solid plant foods. Abuse of soft refining food leads to exhaustion and bone atrophy, and with regular chewing solid foods, especially raw vegetables and fruit, on the contrary, there is a training vessel gums and natural cleansing of plaque.</p>

<p>Of the surgical treatment of periodontal disease using surgery to remove the periodontal pockets, removal of microabscesses and festering gums, bone grafting, removal of infected overgrown soft tissue closure of exposed roots, raised descended gums. One promising area of ​​treatment of periodontal disease is the use of cellular technologies to stimulate the recovery of their own bone. Similar operations are underway in Moscow.</p>

<h2>Prevention of periodontal disease</h2>

<p>For the prevention of periodontal disease should be serious about the state of their teeth:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 at least once a year to visit the dentist for a professional oral hygiene;</li>
<li>Brushing teeth 2 times a day, and possibly after every meal;</li>
<li>Remove it after eating the remains of the interdental spaces with dental floss;</li>
<li>To choose a toothbrush with rounded and not too coarse bristles;</li>
<li>Eat right. For periodontal health in the menu should be physiologically required amount of protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and trace elements. Do not abuse the sweets and eat more fresh organic fruits and vegetables.</li>
</ul>
