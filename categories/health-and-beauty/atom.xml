    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Organic food is no longer useful and safe for human health than the ordinary. To this conclusion was reached by researchers from Stanford University (USA), after an analysis of 240 publications, which have been devoted to food that have appeared in the scientific literature since 1966. The work group was headed by Dan Bravat, it has become the most extensive research in this area, and was published September 4 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.</p>

<p>The so-called organic food - food is grown without the use of pesticides, antibiotics, hormones, etc. - Positioned as much more useful and safer than usual because it is more pure and contains more vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. Organic foods are sometimes almost twice as expensive as products grown using traditional methods, but, despite this, their popularity, especially among the population of developed countries has multiplied over the past decade. For example, in the United States since 1997. by 2011. organic food market has increased from $3600000000 to $24400000000.</p>

<p>To confirm or refute the thesis regarding the significant advantage of one of two types of food over another, the authors conducted a systematic study of the results of 240 reports. 223 of these reports were devoted to a comparison grown by organic or conventional fruits, grains, vegetables, meat, eggs and milk on the content of trace elements, fungal and bacterial contamination and pesticide. The remaining 17 publications covered the health indicators in the context of food consumed. Fully entire array analyzed data published in the scientific literature since January 1966.</p>

<p>The only significant advantage over conventional organ`ic products, in terms of their content of vitamins and minerals, was a higher content of phosphorus, which, according to the authors, can be very useful for people who suffer a deficit of this trace element.</p>

<p>As vitamins, and other beneficial agents for humans, there is clinically significant for human health differences were found. Thus, the authors note that protein and fat composition of organic and ordinary milk were approximately the same, although in some publications and held assumption that organic milk may contain higher amounts of unsaturated fatty acids.</p>

<p>Also, the authors found no convincing evidence that conventional food is much more harmful to health than organic. However, the latter, with 30% less likely contaminated with pesticides than usual, although they can not be called completely free of toxic chemicals. In addition, this difference is hardly noticeable in the case of exceeding the shelf life of products. As bacterial contamination indicators are also approximately equal. The authors suggest that the use of organic chicken and pork reduces the risk of developing resistance to antibiotics, and note that the clinical evidence of this assumption does not exist.</p>

<p>Commenting on the results, the authors noted that they could easily affect the heterogeneity of research methods used in the studies, as well as various factors that affect the safety and quality of products, such as weather, soil composition, methods of farming, etc.
It should be noted that the conclusions made by experts at Stanford University, the same, in general, the results of a study conducted by scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 2009.</p>

Worse, four out of five do not know! In side The drug prescription information and patient education are therefore key stages of care.</p>




<!--more-->




<h2>Herpes types</h2>




<p><strong>Herpes labialis</strong>
He is responsible for cold sores. Frequent, nearly 10 million americans suffer at least one thrust per year. It preferentially affects women (3 women to 2 men).</p>




<p><strong>Genital herpes</strong>
Number of herpes infection carriers subjects estimated 2 million against only 350,000 cases diagnosed! Thus, four out of five are unaware of being infected.</p>




<h2>An impaired life quality</h2>




<p>Genital herpes diagnosis is often difficult because of the lesions diversity or too late consultation and outside attacks. However, the impact on quality of life is very important.</p>




<p>Patients are afraid to have sex because of pain or disease transmitting fear. They are 34% to easily manage their social life and 33% have <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/psychology/depression.html" title="depression">depression</a>.</p>




<p>However, drug treatments exist.</p>




<h2>A little known illness surrounded by taboos</h2>




<p>It is necessary to open the dialogue and break the taboos surrounding this little known disease patients. As well as medication, inform and educate patients is an management integral part. Contamination must be explained, as well as the potential for treatment to facilitate compliance. This stops the immediate effect in virus replication, pain and shortens the surge duration, but virus remains in body.</p>




<p><strong>Infection is severe in late <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/gynecology/pregnancy.html" title="pregnancy">pregnancy</a></strong>
In addition, this infection can be very serious in late pregnancy. It entails a neonatal infection risk (1-2 cases per 100,000 births), the consequences can be serious for infants if treatment is not started quickly.</p>




<h2>How to prevent transmission  herpes virus?</h2>




<p>During a herpes outbreak:</p>




<ul>
<li>Wash hands after touching the lesions and do not scratch the lesions.</li>
<li>Do not share his towels.</li>
<li>Avoid sexual intercourse, even protected by a condom.</li>
<li>Avoid physical contact with newborns, pregnant women, people with skin lesions (eczema, <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/dermatology/psoriasis.html" title="psoriasis">psoriasis</a>, etc.)., Immunocompromised individuals (AIDS, organ transplant, chemotherapy).</li>
</ul>




<p>Outside breakouts, use a condom if the partner has never come into contact with the herpes virus.</p>




<p>In case of herpes labialis (cold sores) to avoid oral-genital sex (sex/mouth) because this virus on the lips can be transmitted to the partner genitals.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/fungus-toenails-onychomycosis/0.jpg" width="200" height="150" title="nail fungus, fungus toenails, onychomycosis" alt="Fungus toenails, onychomycosis">If you find they thicken, become brittle, change color, check out quickly.</p>




<p>The fungus toenails is extremely contagious and can lead to the loss of the nail, then there are effective treatments.</p>




<!--more-->




<h2>The fungus toenails is common</h2>




<p>The fungus toenails is common and transmissible. It affects 3-10% of the French population. Professionals use the term of onychomycosis, which designates a nail infection caused by fungi of three kinds (dermatophytes, yeasts Candida, molds).</p>




<h2>First signs of a nail fungus</h2>




<p>The infection settles slowly. It reaches first the skin between the toes forming a fissure that does not heal. Gradually, the nail is reached. It thickens, crumbles, changes color (yellow or white spots) and becomes painful. In the absence of treatment, it may peel off.</p>




<h2>What are the risk factors for nail fungus?</h2>




<p>Older age, male sex, sports, trauma and repeated injury, a humid environment and certain diseases (bone and joint diseases, diabetes, <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="obesity">obesity</a>, peripheral <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/vascular-disease/" title="vascular disease">vascular disease</a>, <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/dermatology/psoriasis.html" title="psoriasis">psoriasis</a>?).</p>




<p>The infection is caught easily in collective public places humid and warm where you walk barefoot (pool, sauna, dance halls, dressing rooms, etc..).</p>




<p>You can also pass the family, walking barefoot on the carpet, suitable slippers or in the bathroom, including towels or nail clippers. Maceration in shoes, especially sport shoes or boots, is also a major risk factor. Also predispose strain nails or toes that overlap (common in older people).</p>




<h2>In case of nail fungus, early treatment is essential</h2>




<p>A <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/nail-fungus-fungal-nail-disease-symptoms-and-prevention/" title="nail fungus">nail fungus</a> does not heal on its own and instead risk spreading to other nails.</p>




<p>Similarly, the more care is delayed, the more healing is long and difficult. Hence the importance of regularly inspecting her nails, especially if you are part of those at risk.</p>




<p>At the slightest anomaly, talk to your doctor.</p>




<p>A sample of the nail for a mycological examination is necessary to identify the fungus cause and prescribe the appropriate antifungal therapy. Depending on the degree of achievement of the nail, it will be local (application of a varnish) and/or oral. However, be patient and be sure to follow your doctor&rsquo;s instructions. Indeed, the treatment is long (often more than 6 months), as the nail grows very slowly.</p>




<h2>Tips to avoid a nail fungus</h2>




<ul>
<li>Systematically and thoroughly dry your feet, especially between each toe.</li>
<li>Avoid walking barefoot.</li>
<li>Wear personal sandals by the pool, in the locker room&hellip;</li>
<li>Do not lend your slippers.</li>
<li>Do not pay either your towel.</li>
<li>Disinfect with alcohol scissors, nail files and nail clippers used for toenails.</li>
<li>Cut your toe nails short and straight.</li>
<li>Limit wearing sneakers your physical activity.</li>
<li>Wear leather shoes, which limit maceration.</li>
<li>Avoid tight shoes, too tightly in plastic.</li>
<li>Try not to your shoes, especially sport.</li>
<li>Adopt cotton socks, especially for sports.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://medusanews.com/articles/solar-capsules-beta-carotene-to-better-tan/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-15T09:17:00+06:00</updated>
    <id>http://medusanews.com/articles/solar-capsules-beta-carotene-to-better-tan</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/solar-capsules-beta-carotene-to-better-tan/0.jpg" width="200" height="150" title="beta-carotene, solar capsules, discoloration of the skin" alt="Solar capsules (beta-carotene) to better tan?">Expected to prepare the skin for tanning, what is the actual effect of food supplements beta-carotene?
Do they tan, can you be more exposed to the sun and they protect cancer?
Focus on solar capsules.</p>




<!--more-->




<h2>Tanning and dietary supplements beta-carotene</h2>




<p><strong>Beta-carotene is a pigment that belongs to the family of carotenes.</strong>
It is found naturally in many plants very colorful, especially yellow-orange, like carrots, melons, peppers, apricots, as well as green leafy vegetables eg.</p>




<p><strong>Beta-carotene: an orange color of the skin</strong>
High doses of dietary supplements of beta-carotene (from 30 mg/day) or a very high consumption of foods rich in beta-carotene cause yellow/orange discoloration of the skin that doctors call &ldquo;carotenodermie&rdquo;. Such coloration is not hazardous to health and resolves when the amount of carotenoids absorbed decreases.</p>




<p><strong>An antioxidant against aging skin</strong>
Beta-carotene, also called provitamin A, is a precursor of vitamin A, which plays a role as an antioxidant, that is to say, it helps to fight against the excessive production of free radicals responsible for aging. Golden sun exposure are well known to accelerate the aging of the skin.</p>




<blockquote><p>For example, taking a dietary supplement beta-carotene (or adopt a diet rich in beta-carotene, and therefore rich in colorful fruits and vegetables) could accelerate the discoloration of the skin and therefore the tan, while protecting the skin from aging!</p></blockquote>




<p><strong>This is how many solar capsules are now available to enhance your tan, but their effectiveness in this area has not been formally demonstrated scientifically and without bias, as the duration of treatment and dosage to use.</strong></p>




<h2>Take solar capsules before going on vacation?</h2>




<p><strong>In the current state of knowledge, we can not recommend for or against solar capsules.</strong></p>




<blockquote><p>What is certain is that a cure of beta-carotene, even 15 days before exposure, during and after, does not relieve apply every two hours sunscreen with high protective index or n authorizes to expose longer or the hottest hours of the day.</p></blockquote>




<p>In other words, with or without beta-carotene, the main rules of prevention of skin cancer and accelerated skin aging are needed.</p>




<p>Finally, if you want to buy solar capsules should not exceed the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended daily dose. Also note that these supplements are cons-indicated in children, pregnant or nursing women.</p>




<h2>Beta-carotene and cancer: protective effect or a negative effect?</h2>




<blockquote><p>These are: an excess of vitamin A can be toxic to the body, but this is not the case with beta-carotene, the vitamin A transformation is blocked as if the vitamin A status is already high. Overdosing seems so limited with beta-carotene.</p></blockquote>




<p><strong>For twenty years, studies consistently highlight the existence of a link between cancer prevention and beta-carotene</strong>: regular consumption, sometimes at high doses of beta-carotene would protect certain cancers.</p>




<p><strong>But, according to a study published in 2005 Inserm, this relationship is reversed in the case of smoking. Beta-carotene would be harmful.</strong>
Thus, smokers supplemented women see their risk of smoking-related cancers increase in proportion to the amount of beta-carotene consumed (20, 30, or 50 mg/day): lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, head and neck, thyroid, ovary, cervix, etc.. It is as if significant absorption of beta-carotene favored the formation of &ldquo;unusual cleavage products of carotenoids involved in the development of cancer&rdquo;. Note that this increase was observed both in smokers than in former smokers.
However, not all studies attest to this carcinogenic effect of beta-carotene dose in case of smoking. Thus, in 2012 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded reassuringly to the lack of increase of lung cancer in heavy smokers to levels of beta-carotene supplementation &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; (6 to 15 mg/day).</p>




<p><strong>So, do I take it or not solar capsules if I smoke?</strong>
To date, there is no reason to ban supplements beta-carotene for smokers, if consumed in reasonable amounts, ie less than 15 mg/day.
The best way to protect against cancer is to not smoke or stop!</p>




<p><strong>In summary:</strong></p>




<blockquote><p>If you want to prepare your skin to the sun and enhance your tan, you can of course make solar capsules, but no guarantee of effectiveness except to have a more colorful skin! By cons, apply the dose indicated on the instructions of dietary supplement and in any case, apply sunscreen to protect you from UV.</p></blockquote>

This is the restless legs">The restless legs syndrome is not known.
<strong>It appears at the two legs of impatience, temporarily relieved by movement.</strong></p>


<!-- more -->


<h2>Restless: twice as many women as men</h2>




<p>The restless legs also called &ldquo;impatience&rdquo; is due to an abnormality of the neurotransmitters dopamine (unlike Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, there is no neuronal death). It affects twice as many women than men, especially after age 50, and there is often a family history. This syndrome also occurs more often during pregnancy and after menopause without really knowing why, although a role of hormones is suspected.</p>




<blockquote><p>The impatience manifested by discomfort in both legs with the urge to move the legs, causing an almost immediate relief but short.</p></blockquote>




<p>This very unpleasant feeling has the characteristic to occur exclusively at rest, sitting or lying down, preferably in the evening and in the early part of the night.
<strong>This results in great difficulty in falling asleep, making restless legs the second leading cause of sleep disorders after sleep apnea syndrome.</strong></p>




<p>In 80% of cases, patients also suffer from automatic and periodic limb movements. The incidence of disorders varies greatly, ranging from several days to a few times a year by seizures.</p>




<p><em>Note that the restless legs seems to correlate with the occurrence of hypertension, diabetes and obesity.</em></p>




<h2>Restless Legs: strong repercussions in everyday life</h2>




<p>One can easily imagine the dramatic social and professional repercussions, due to insomnia and exhaustion, abnormal movements and the immediate need to move, making it impossible entertainment, transport or sitting at the hairdresser.</p>




<p>The medical check passes first by looking for an iron deficiency, which improves the correction disorders. Then the treatment is based on the administration of dopamine at lower than those used in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease doses.</p>




<blockquote><p>In conclusion, it should be noted that the restless legs syndrome exists and treated.
And if you suffer from sleep disorders, do not forget about your impatience to your doctor!</p></blockquote>
