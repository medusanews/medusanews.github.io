    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/90-day-diet-of-a-separate-food/img.jpg" alt="alt"><strong>90 days, a separate food</strong> - the original scheme, based on the classic separation of power, which is strictly regulated on certain days. The eponymous book authors promise us neither more nor less than the acceleration of metabolism, dumping 25 kilograms, and no side effects to health. Let&rsquo;s try to find out how justified their claims, why lovers always sweet like this program and what are the medical background to find on the course. <!--more-->In general, the authors Polyanshek Hrobart and popular Slovak writer and their book far exceeded the circulations of the world best sellers - it&rsquo;s hard to say what is more: a good system or a successful advertising campaign. Doctors do not support the principles of a separate food are no randomized studies that clearly indicate the usefulness of this approach. But <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/citrus-diet-for-weight-loss-diet-menus-on-citrus-reviews-recipes/" title="reviews">reviews</a> the system works, it also trains the habits of a healthy diet and discipline, and it is important in the fight against excess weight.</p>

<h2>90 days separate food</h2>

<p>All three months divided into four &quot;block&quot;, which alternate in succession - before the end of the scheme does not change course. Each four-day cycle is required for the execution, and if you have broken at any point, it is necessary to go back to the beginning of the cycle. If the failure lasted more than a week, you need a hitch (not necessary to continue to destroy the pastries and drink) and return to the beginning of the diet. The scheme is simple and intuitive catchy. Breakfast at any stage is minimal and you build it yourself from a glass of any fruit, starting and ending with exotic blueberries or any fruit as one. Do you want a banana? No problem, eat it, from one end of the world banana come.</p>

<p><strong>Protein loading</strong> - mostly animal protein, although you can use nuts. The preferred fish, lean meat, tofu, cottage cheese, fermented baked milk. Permission is granted to a little lettuce and a small slice of wholemeal bread. No sugar or other carbohydrates, do not forget about seafood, to get a normal fat.</p>

<p><strong>Amyloid day</strong> - this type of vegetables, potatoes, legumes, and complex carbohydrates. On this day, the protein should be minimized and should only be fats and vegetable absolutely necessary amounts for cooking. Salt use smaller, replace it seasonings.</p>

<p><strong>Pure carbohydrate a day</strong> - a favorite day sweet tooth. Fruits and even chocolate are allowed - only in moderation. Moreover, for dinner you can eat a little dessert. But remember, the less simple (fast) carbohydrates, the better.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin day</strong> - it can still be called a discharge. Unsweetened fruit, some salad, seeds and nuts.</p>

<p><strong>Fully discharge day</strong> on mineral water at the end of a cycle of 29 consecutive days, consider carefully.</p>

<p>The main requirement - strict eating regime, as &quot;the book says&quot;. With breakfast you realize no amateur, fruit and berries, but the rest of the diet are allowed to enjoy in a strictly allotted time - from 12 am to 19 pm. The principle is simple - for lunch you can eat food to satiety, and for dinner have to eat a third less dining portions.</p>

<p>Drinking regime to do the maximum to the bottom of the vitamin and supplements can be taken from ascorbic acid and fish oil.</p>

<ul>
<li>Scrambled eggs with grated cheese, seafood cocktail;</li>
<li>A glass of broth, boiled beef, a slice of corn bread;</li>
<li>Broth of vegetables, boiled or baked potatoes;</li>
<li>Buckwheat with fat and a small piece of bread.</li>
<li>Pasta with tomato sauce;</li>
<li>Oatmeal on skim milk;</li>
<li>A piece of chocolate and crackers - sweet on this day are allowed to, you can even eat some ice cream.</li>
<li>Thick compote of dried fruits;</li>
<li>Fresh fruit salad with honey sauce;</li>
<li>Juice, fresh vegetable salad, pine nuts.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Pros and cons of the diet 90 days separate food</h2>

<p>Considered a long course, with detailed instructions, unloading days and the possibility of a smooth and controlled diet.</p>

<p>One of the few diets which completely &quot;legal&quot; you can eat chocolate, cookies and ice cream.</p>

<p>Change &quot;modes&quot; and the abundance of food is not even allowed to pall after a couple of months from the start of the diet. In addition, the alternation of days will help get rid of the glycogen stores in the muscles, which will accelerate the burning of fat from the stock.</p>

<p>Ability to make fasting day and return to the beginning of the cycle in the event of unauthorized use of a product or holidays, most diets have to start again.</p>

<p>We need a serious preparation, planning and cooking meals for the next day - discipline is very important.</p>

<p>There is no proven medical reason for separate meals, also proved that inhibit enzymes friend - friend, in case of splitting of food from various sources.</p>

<p>Many nutritionists speak of separate principles of nutrition, as a pseudoscientific delirium, likely losing weight will be due to lower caloric content and depletion of glycogen stores. All thinking about the health benefits can be safely omitted - such data is unavailable.</p>

<p>Pressure therapy - it&rsquo;s just a physical therapy action, which we should not expect miracles. This method is necessary for people who have impaired microcirculation. The blood flow in small vessels of the skin can suffer because of the sedentary lifestyle of various diseases, as well as because of their age. In women 45-50 years after the hormonal changes that are often accompanied by swelling. Sometimes they are invisible to the eye but the circulation of blood and lymph vessels in usually broken, and the effect of these processes becomes cellulite.</p>

<p>I should say that pressotherapy - not the cheapest procedure. Its cost is around 1000-2000 rubles. The entire course of therapy typically consists of 10-12 sessions. These prices do not explain the high efficiency of the procedure, which is comparable to a conventional massage. But the machine, which is carried out using pressure therapy, of course, costs money, and considerable. Accordingly, the procedure is, by definition, be more expensive than the same massage, which requires only a table and skilful hands of the masseur.</p>

<p>Pressure therapy is painless, so the procedure does not need to be afraid. You will dress suit with compartments for air. Then you lie on the couch, and the air is pumped in a suit. This unit allows you to adjust the mode of pressure therapy. There are various programs that are usually either directed to a massage, or a lymphatic drainage.</p>

<p>In some salons are machines for pressure therapy with different &quot;twists&quot;. For example, with infrared heating, which in turn has a positive effect on the microcirculation. Temperature effect allows dilate blood vessels and improve blood flow. However, hardly heating significantly increases the effectiveness of the procedure, increase the temperature because the surface of the skin can be even <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/how-to-lose-weight-at-home/" title="at home">at home</a>. For example, immersed in a hot bath. The value of these innovations is likely to hit the ear trusting client and persuade him to pay for the expensive procedure.</p>

<p>Does the pressure therapy to lose weight?</p>

<p>As already stated, pressure does not affect the body fat mass. Neither the temperature nor the massage effect is not able to save you from excess weight. &quot;Lose Ground&quot; - nothing more than a slogan to lure customers. Pressure therapy - is a good way to fight cellulite, but no way to lose weight.</p>

<p>Why, then, the Internet has a lot of positive feedback about the pressure therapy, just as the procedure for weight loss? Why do people say that the field a few sessions they managed to lose 1-3 kilograms of weight? The mechanism of this &quot;weight loss&quot; is similar to what happens after the use of diuretic teas or limit salt in food. Weight loss is due to excretion of 1-3 liters of fluid.</p>

<p>However, in contrast to the same diuretics, pressure really brings &quot;extra&quot; liquid. Exit the water that has accumulated in the intercellular space due to the deterioration of the microcirculation. She does not need the body, and only puts pressure on small blood vessels, narrowing of the lumen and preventing normal blood flow.</p>

<p>Pressure therapy - no more than a cosmetic procedure. It will improve the condition of your skin and help in the fight against cellulite, displays the excess fluid from the tissues and eliminate congestion. As a method of pressure therapy is useless for weight loss, so do not do it on a bet. Currently, the methods of weight loss without effort there.</p>

Besides the obvious harm to health (people with its presence will develop diabetes, <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/atherosclerosis.html" title="atherosclerosis">atherosclerosis</a> and other disorders), the disease significantly spoils the appearance, worsening and even disfiguring figure.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the term &quot;<a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="obesity">obesity</a>&quot; means a pathology, this word is unpleasant, is clearly negative, to some extent condemneth group. Naturally, neither one nor the other owners do not like excess weight, which often prefer to call his lack of completeness, obesity, but not this definition. However, there is a way to dot the &quot;i&quot;: some simple calculations help to distinguish the fullness of obesity.</p>

<h2>What is BMI and what is it for?</h2>

<p>On the body mass index (BMI), we have repeatedly said in other posts, devoted to <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/gone-month-after-weight-loss-how-to-restore-the-month-following-the-diet/" title="weight loss">weight loss</a>. It refers to the ratio of height and weight, which is expressed by a numerical value and gives an indication of normal, insufficient or overweight humans. It calculated it is very simple: the value of the body weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.</p>

<h2>More clearly this can be represented as follows:</h2>

<p>The normal value of the index in women vary in the region from 19 to 25. The difference between these figures is large enough that allows index capture growth-weight ratios in people of any stature. For this reason and asthenics fragile and strong hypersthenics have at its mass index &quot;fit&quot; into the gap from 19 to 25. If the resulting number is greater than the upper limit, it is clearly talking about excess weight and justification of the mighty physique and broad bone this case untenable.</p>

<p>To make it easier to navigate in the calculations, we give an example. Take the girl with above average growth of 170 cm and weighing 60 kg, and calculate her BMI.</p>

<p>Thus, a person with such parameters do not suffer deficiency and excess weight. Unfortunately, some can only envy like&hellip; And now, when we have understood the basics, let&rsquo;s go further.</p>

<p>There are many ways to define obesity and its powers, of which we give only the most used. However, regardless of what kind of degree is awarded this disorder, obesity must be fought. However, many Americans do not agree with us. In the US, there is even a special thick society; once a certain time, its members come from different cities and states, arrange meetings and meetings to teach &quot;newbies&quot; that being overweight - this is normal, and we must love themselves as they are. We will not challenge the right of others to their own opinion, but remain at its European convictions <strong>obesity - it is not the norm, and the disease that it is necessary to get rid of.</strong></p>

<h2>Determining the degree of obesity by BMI. Method one</h2>

<p>In this case, the degree is determined depending on the body mass index.</p>

<ul>
<li>BMI of 19-25 is the norm;</li>
<li>BMI of 25-30 indicates a &quot;pre-obese&quot; - increased body weight, which is necessary to normalize;</li>
<li>BMI of 30-35 corresponds to the first degree of obesity;</li>
<li>BMI of 35-40 speaks of the second degree;</li>
<li>BMI above 40 indicates the presence of third-degree obesity.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let&rsquo;s see, would be considered our hypothetical woman slim, if not weighed 60 and 90 kilograms.</p>

<p>The result - the first degree. As you can see, this method is quite liberal, because even at much lower weight, people often consider themselves full and try to get rid of the extra kilos to look like the most aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<h2>Determining the degree of obesity. Method two</h2>

<p>The second method is to determine overweight relative to the norm in percentage is used much less frequently than the first.</p>

<p>If &quot;preponderance&quot; is not more than 10%, it is not obese and completion. With an excess of 10-29% are diagnosed with &quot;1 degree of obesity&quot;, with 30-49% - the second degree, at 50% and more - the third degree.</p>

<p>For example, initially the girl, which in our example &quot;recovered&quot; from 60 to 90 kg, had asthenic constitution, that is, the notorious 60 kg were her ideal weight. Calculate how much it exceeded its weight &quot;limit&quot; when the stout up to 90 kg. Let us remember and construct elementary arithmetic proportion, although, in principle, you can make calculations in mind.</p>

<p>X = 150%, that is excess relatively normal weight is 50%.</p>

<p>The result - our &quot;guinea&quot; came to the last, third-degree obesity! It turns out, the use of different methods give very different results&hellip; What does this mean? Only that <strong>ideal system for determining the degree of obesity does not exist, and the calculations are made to give only approximate figures.</strong></p>

<p>In fact, it is very difficult to put on the same level with people very different physique, height, shape and features, etc., and provide a single formula for all. At the present time to determine the presence of obesity and its degrees are the first of the designated ways, but objectively can hardly be considered the ideal. Imagine yourself: well, how can not very tall woman weighing 90 kg be considered &quot;little&quot; full?</p>

<p>However, morality is not in it. We will not complain about the errors of the individual formulas, as well as distressed relative imperfection of the health system and the structure of the world as a whole. We draw attention to something else: thinking about the state of the figure, do not indulge in the calculations and determine how many kilograms you can without remorse &quot;eat&quot; that is not officially regarded as a thick. Control yourself: honest look in the mirror will tell you much more than any arithmetic, it will show you your weaknesses will help you plan activities and then when you are prefer to allow a joy to watch the progress. And then you will cease to care about the issue, there you are overweight or not: You will continuously work on ourselves and better understand that the main thing - not the absence of too full hips or too wide waist, which can be just your feature and exercise, a relief, the harmony of the entire body.</p>
