    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/90-day-diet-of-a-separate-food/img.jpg" alt="alt"><strong>90 days, a separate food</strong> - the original scheme, based on the classic separation of power, which is strictly regulated on certain days. The eponymous book authors promise us neither more nor less than the acceleration of metabolism, dumping 25 kilograms, and no side effects to health. Let&rsquo;s try to find out how justified their claims, why lovers always sweet like this program and what are the medical background to find on the course. <!--more-->In general, the authors Polyanshek Hrobart and popular Slovak writer and their book far exceeded the circulations of the world best sellers - it&rsquo;s hard to say what is more: a good system or a successful advertising campaign. Doctors do not support the principles of a separate food are no randomized studies that clearly indicate the usefulness of this approach. But <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/citrus-diet-for-weight-loss-diet-menus-on-citrus-reviews-recipes/" title="reviews">reviews</a> the system works, it also trains the habits of a healthy diet and discipline, and it is important in the fight against excess weight.</p>

<h2>90 days separate food</h2>

<p>All three months divided into four &quot;block&quot;, which alternate in succession - before the end of the scheme does not change course. Each four-day cycle is required for the execution, and if you have broken at any point, it is necessary to go back to the beginning of the cycle. If the failure lasted more than a week, you need a hitch (not necessary to continue to destroy the pastries and drink) and return to the beginning of the diet. The scheme is simple and intuitive catchy. Breakfast at any stage is minimal and you build it yourself from a glass of any fruit, starting and ending with exotic blueberries or any fruit as one. Do you want a banana? No problem, eat it, from one end of the world banana come.</p>

<p><strong>Protein loading</strong> - mostly animal protein, although you can use nuts. The preferred fish, lean meat, tofu, cottage cheese, fermented baked milk. Permission is granted to a little lettuce and a small slice of wholemeal bread. No sugar or other carbohydrates, do not forget about seafood, to get a normal fat.</p>

<p><strong>Amyloid day</strong> - this type of vegetables, potatoes, legumes, and complex carbohydrates. On this day, the protein should be minimized and should only be fats and vegetable absolutely necessary amounts for cooking. Salt use smaller, replace it seasonings.</p>

<p><strong>Pure carbohydrate a day</strong> - a favorite day sweet tooth. Fruits and even chocolate are allowed - only in moderation. Moreover, for dinner you can eat a little dessert. But remember, the less simple (fast) carbohydrates, the better.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamin day</strong> - it can still be called a discharge. Unsweetened fruit, some salad, seeds and nuts.</p>

<p><strong>Fully discharge day</strong> on mineral water at the end of a cycle of 29 consecutive days, consider carefully.</p>

<p>The main requirement - strict eating regime, as &quot;the book says&quot;. With breakfast you realize no amateur, fruit and berries, but the rest of the diet are allowed to enjoy in a strictly allotted time - from 12 am to 19 pm. The principle is simple - for lunch you can eat food to satiety, and for dinner have to eat a third less dining portions.</p>

<p>Drinking regime to do the maximum to the bottom of the vitamin and supplements can be taken from ascorbic acid and fish oil.</p>

<ul>
<li>Scrambled eggs with grated cheese, seafood cocktail;</li>
<li>A glass of broth, boiled beef, a slice of corn bread;</li>
<li>Broth of vegetables, boiled or baked potatoes;</li>
<li>Buckwheat with fat and a small piece of bread.</li>
<li>Pasta with tomato sauce;</li>
<li>Oatmeal on skim milk;</li>
<li>A piece of chocolate and crackers - sweet on this day are allowed to, you can even eat some ice cream.</li>
<li>Thick compote of dried fruits;</li>
<li>Fresh fruit salad with honey sauce;</li>
<li>Juice, fresh vegetable salad, pine nuts.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Pros and cons of the diet 90 days separate food</h2>

<p>Considered a long course, with detailed instructions, unloading days and the possibility of a smooth and controlled diet.</p>

<p>One of the few diets which completely &quot;legal&quot; you can eat chocolate, cookies and ice cream.</p>

<p>Change &quot;modes&quot; and the abundance of food is not even allowed to pall after a couple of months from the start of the diet. In addition, the alternation of days will help get rid of the glycogen stores in the muscles, which will accelerate the burning of fat from the stock.</p>

<p>Ability to make fasting day and return to the beginning of the cycle in the event of unauthorized use of a product or holidays, most diets have to start again.</p>

<p>We need a serious preparation, planning and cooking meals for the next day - discipline is very important.</p>

<p>There is no proven medical reason for separate meals, also proved that inhibit enzymes friend - friend, in case of splitting of food from various sources.</p>

<p>Many nutritionists speak of separate principles of nutrition, as a pseudoscientific delirium, likely losing weight will be due to lower caloric content and depletion of glycogen stores. All thinking about the health benefits can be safely omitted - such data is unavailable.</p>

<p>Pressure therapy - it&rsquo;s just a physical therapy action, which we should not expect miracles. This method is necessary for people who have impaired microcirculation. The blood flow in small vessels of the skin can suffer because of the sedentary lifestyle of various diseases, as well as because of their age. In women 45-50 years after the hormonal changes that are often accompanied by swelling. Sometimes they are invisible to the eye but the circulation of blood and lymph vessels in usually broken, and the effect of these processes becomes cellulite.</p>

<p>I should say that pressotherapy - not the cheapest procedure. Its cost is around 1000-2000 rubles. The entire course of therapy typically consists of 10-12 sessions. These prices do not explain the high efficiency of the procedure, which is comparable to a conventional massage. But the machine, which is carried out using pressure therapy, of course, costs money, and considerable. Accordingly, the procedure is, by definition, be more expensive than the same massage, which requires only a table and skilful hands of the masseur.</p>

<p>Pressure therapy is painless, so the procedure does not need to be afraid. You will dress suit with compartments for air. Then you lie on the couch, and the air is pumped in a suit. This unit allows you to adjust the mode of pressure therapy. There are various programs that are usually either directed to a massage, or a lymphatic drainage.</p>

<p>In some salons are machines for pressure therapy with different &quot;twists&quot;. For example, with infrared heating, which in turn has a positive effect on the microcirculation. Temperature effect allows dilate blood vessels and improve blood flow. However, hardly heating significantly increases the effectiveness of the procedure, increase the temperature because the surface of the skin can be even <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/how-to-lose-weight-at-home/" title="at home">at home</a>. For example, immersed in a hot bath. The value of these innovations is likely to hit the ear trusting client and persuade him to pay for the expensive procedure.</p>

<p>Does the pressure therapy to lose weight?</p>

<p>As already stated, pressure does not affect the body fat mass. Neither the temperature nor the massage effect is not able to save you from excess weight. &quot;Lose Ground&quot; - nothing more than a slogan to lure customers. Pressure therapy - is a good way to fight cellulite, but no way to lose weight.</p>

<p>Why, then, the Internet has a lot of positive feedback about the pressure therapy, just as the procedure for weight loss? Why do people say that the field a few sessions they managed to lose 1-3 kilograms of weight? The mechanism of this &quot;weight loss&quot; is similar to what happens after the use of diuretic teas or limit salt in food. Weight loss is due to excretion of 1-3 liters of fluid.</p>

<p>However, in contrast to the same diuretics, pressure really brings &quot;extra&quot; liquid. Exit the water that has accumulated in the intercellular space due to the deterioration of the microcirculation. She does not need the body, and only puts pressure on small blood vessels, narrowing of the lumen and preventing normal blood flow.</p>

<p>Pressure therapy - no more than a cosmetic procedure. It will improve the condition of your skin and help in the fight against cellulite, displays the excess fluid from the tissues and eliminate congestion. As a method of pressure therapy is useless for weight loss, so do not do it on a bet. Currently, the methods of weight loss without effort there.</p>
