This is the restless legs&rsquo;" >The restless legs syndrome is not known.
<strong>It appears at the two legs of impatience, temporarily relieved by movement.</strong><!-- more --></p>

<h2>Restless: twice as many women as men</h2>

<p>The restless legs also called &ldquo;impatience&rdquo; is due to an abnormality of the neurotransmitters dopamine (unlike Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, there is no neuronal death). It affects twice as many women than men, especially after age 50, and there is often a family history. This syndrome also occurs more often during pregnancy and after menopause without really knowing why, although a role of hormones is suspected.</p>

<blockquote><p>The impatience manifested by discomfort in both legs with the urge to move the legs, causing an almost immediate relief but short.</p></blockquote>

<p>This very unpleasant feeling has the characteristic to occur exclusively at rest, sitting or lying down, preferably in the evening and in the early part of the night.
<strong>This results in great difficulty in falling asleep, making restless legs the second leading cause of sleep disorders after sleep apnea syndrome.</strong></p>

<p>In 80% of cases, patients also suffer from automatic and periodic limb movements. The incidence of disorders varies greatly, ranging from several days to a few times a year by seizures.</p>

<p><em>Note that the restless legs seems to correlate with the occurrence of hypertension, diabetes and obesity.</em></p>

<h2>Restless Legs: strong repercussions in everyday life</h2>

<p>One can easily imagine the dramatic social and professional repercussions, due to insomnia and exhaustion, abnormal movements and the immediate need to move, making it impossible entertainment, transport or sitting at the hairdresser.</p>

<p>The medical check passes first by looking for an iron deficiency, which improves the correction disorders. Then the treatment is based on the administration of dopamine at lower than those used in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease doses.</p>

<blockquote><p>In conclusion, it should be noted that the restless legs syndrome exists and treated.
And if you suffer from sleep disorders, do not forget about your impatience to your doctor!</p></blockquote>

    <id>http://medusanews.com/articles/get-rid-of-allergies-forever-causes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://medusanews.com/images/get-rid-of-allergies-forever/image.jpg">http://medusanews.com/images/get-rid-of-allergies-forever/image.jpg</a>" width="200" height="150" title="&lsquo;Get rid of allergies forever, pathogenic microflora of the intestine, causes of allergies&rsquo; &lsquo;Get rid of allergies forever. The causes of allergies&rsquo;" > Of allergy contributes to the pathogenic intestinal microflora. Scientists around the world are studying the causes of allergies, because in the last few decades, the world has seen a rapid increase in allergic diseases and according to WHO every fifth child is born with allergies. Allergies &ndash; is an individual reaction to certain substances (allergens) after contact with them.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The causes of allergies and current treatments</h2>

<p>In parallel with the increasing number of allergies and a list of allergens, which began to get even the most innocent-looking substance. Currently, there are so many new allergens that to protect itself from them, and to exclude from your diet and environment is not possible. Allergic reactions can cause food, household dust, pollen and plant fluff, pet hair, cosmetics, medicines and much more.</p>

<p>Allergy symptoms in different people as diverse &ndash; coughing, sneezing, snot, itching, rash on the body, swelling of the mucous membranes and even asthma. In severe cases, anaphylactic shock can occur &ndash; the most dangerous manifestation of allergic reaction, which in the absence of immediate medical attention to result in death. If there are signs of anaphylactic shock, such as seizures, loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, vomiting, rash all over the body, involuntary urination and defecation, you should immediately call an ambulance.</p>

<p>Modern drugs, widely advertised in the media, unfortunately, do not eliminate the causes of the emergence and development of allergies, and are directed only by addressing its symptoms and relief of the patient. Allergy treatment passes through the standard procedure &ndash; first samples are taken to establish the allergen in order to avoid contact with him, and then assigned to an antihistamine and immune-boosting drugs. But this approach can not be considered the treatment because the treatment of any disease it is important to establish the root cause that caused it, and fix it.</p>

<p>Also popular method of treatment of specific immunotherapy (SIT), the essence of which is the regular administration of low doses of a specific allergen with a gradual increase, which stimulates the immune system and leads to a resistance to it. SIT prolonged treatment and more efficient &ndash; reducing the need for medications the patient, the symptoms are greatly reduced, which is especially important in asthma attacks. SIT is a basic treatment of asthma, by which it is possible to achieve a prolonged remission.</p>

<p>The method is definitely more effective than the simple application of antihistamines, but the downside of it is that in allergic reaction rarely occurs on a single allergen. Most of several allergens and their number increases with time. Develop immunity to any one allergen, the body begins to react to the new stuff, and so on to infinity, because the cause of allergies is still not resolved.</p>

<h2>Get rid of the allergy will forever intestinal microflora</h2>

<p>Scientists still can not name the exact cause of the allergy, why the same adverse environmental and technological conditions in some relatively healthy people cause allergies and others do not. But already found exactly what one of the main causes of allergies is to reduce the number of beneficial microflora in the gut colonization and its pathogenic microbes is called dysbiosis (dysbiosis).</p>

<p>Many people underestimate the lack of knowledge of the role of beneficial microflora for normal body function. Useful healthy human intestinal flora consists of 2-3 kg microorganisms which produce fiber of a variety of vitamins, hormones, amino acids, enzymes, hemoglobin and improve immunity, promote good assimilation of iron. In addition, the intestinal microflora and neutralizes harmful pathogens.</p>

<p>If a person prevails in the gut microflora useful, it copes with its tasks. If the number of beneficial microflora is reduced, which most often occurs with antibiotic treatment, it took place immediately pathogenic bacteria that without meeting resistance, are beginning to multiply, causing inflammation of the gastro &ndash; intestinal tract.</p>

<p>Then begin to destroy pathogenic microflora integrity of the intestinal mucosa, and decreases its protective barrier function, whereby allergens and toxins may enter freely into the body. In addition, pathogenic microflora begins to actively produce histamine and other substances promoting the development of allergy. Therefore, doctors have long known rule that the cure is dysbiosis, and allergic reactions immediately back down, appearing less frequently or disappear completely.</p>

<p>Dysbacteriosis contributes not only to the emergence of symptoms of allergies, but also metabolic disorders, cardiovascular and endocrine diseases and even depression. Scientists have found a clear link between the presence of dysbiosis and the level of anxiety a person who at dysbiosis increased almost 3 times. And the fact that the problems with the skin, hair and nails can not be removed any creams and cosmetics, without solving the problem of dysbiosis, long time it is not a secret.</p>

<p>Therefore, it can be said without exaggeration that the intestinal microflora is the key to the health of the body and each person has to take care of her, not only to get rid of all allergies, but also to avoid the many other diseases. For this it is necessary to organize your diet to a diet rich in plant-dominated fiber and fiber products, especially vegetables, fruits, cereals from whole grains, bran bread, and milk products.</p>

<p>If you want to be healthy, in any case, do not overeat, start a one-day fasting yourself to help the body as excess food is not digested and starts to rot in the gut, poisoning it. German physician Max Gerson, a lifetime studying the dependence of cancer from power in his book &ldquo;The treatment of cancer,&rdquo; says that in his research of 10,000 cancer cases, only one came from irreversible changes in the body, and all the rest of 9999 are the result of poisoning their own</p>

<p>If you regularly take care of the purity of his bowel and healthy nutrition necessary for the beneficial microflora, then not only will get rid of allergies, but in the future and avoid many serious diseases.</p>

    <link href="http://medusanews.com/articles/diseases-of-the-thyroid-gland/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-02T20:53:00+06:00</updated>
    <id>http://medusanews.com/articles/diseases-of-the-thyroid-gland</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://medusanews.com/images/thyroid-disease-hypothyroidism/image.jpg">http://medusanews.com/images/thyroid-disease-hypothyroidism/image.jpg</a>" width="200" height="150" title="&lsquo;Thyroid disease, hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism symptoms, hyperthyroidism causes, hyperthyroidism symptoms&rsquo; &lsquo;Diseases of the thyroid gland. Causes and symptoms of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism&rsquo;" > Thyroid disorders require prompt diagnosis and treatment. Thyroid gland without reason called the small conductor of a large orchestra, emphasizing that at small sizes (at a rate of about 15-20 grams), it plays a vital role in directing the overall operation of the complex formation as the human body.</p>

<p>It is the most important part of a complex human endocrine system, along with the pituitary gland, adrenal glands, pancreas, thymus gland and gonads.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>These glands produce and secrete into the blood of about 50 types of hormones. The thyroid gland produces only two kinds of hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), but no! With their help, it regulates the body&rsquo;s metabolism, the cardiovascular and central nervous system, and manages the psycho &ndash; emotional and sexual activity.</p>

<p>It is up to the thyroid gland depends on the psycho-emotional state of a person, that is, whether he is irritable, aggressive, quick-tempered and ready at any moment to lose self-control, or, conversely, apathetic, passive and indifferent to everything.</p>

<p>From these two hormones depends on body temperature, heart rate, the rate of burning calories and more. A healthy body produces these hormones for as long as necessary for the proper function. But, for failures of the thyroid gland, the necessary hormones starts to be produced more or less the norm, which is equally bad.</p>

<h2>The causes and symptoms of hypothyroidism</h2>

<p>Causes of hypothyroidism &ndash; reduced function of the thyroid gland, in which hormone production becomes insufficient, which is manifested lethargy, apathy, drowsiness, chilliness, fatigue, decreased immunity and slowing metabolism. The main symptoms of hypothyroidism, which should pay close attention &ndash; the appetite is reduced, but the weight increases, performance decreases bowel, constipation appear also thinner nails, they appear grooves and thickening.</p>

<p>Hypothyroidism begins quietly, and all of these symptoms, you see, we are usually easy to explain to stress, fatigue and tiredness. Instead check your thyroid hormone levels and normalize metabolism, sit on a diet, the result of which will not, and harm to an unbalanced diet, typical of nearly all diets, we currently add.</p>

<p>The main causes of hypothyroidism, according to doctors &ndash; an inflammation of the thyroid gland, thyroid congenital anomalies, of her injury, radiation exposure, lack of function of the pituitary hormones, multiple surgeries and a lack of iodine in the body. Doctors are advised to adjust your diet so that the table is always present iodine-containing foods such as seaweed, sea fish, citrus fruits, beets, potatoes, tomatoes.</p>

<p>Most of iodine contained in seaweed and fish products in the rest of his relatively few. But it is worth noting that all is good in moderation, and foods containing iodine, is also not be abused. For example, now so popular Japanese dish, like rolls, contain too much iodine, because it uses algae, which can negatively affect the thyroid gland.  Therefore, doctors are advised to eat no more than 2-3 rolls a week.</p>

<h2>The causes and symptoms of hyperthyroidism</h2>

<p>The symptoms and causes of hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism are opposite, because in this disease the thyroid gland begins to produce hormones more than the norm and its function increases. The main symptoms of hyperthyroidism &ndash; a person loses weight rapidly, experiencing constant hunger, frequent diarrhea, becomes irritable, aggressive, his trembling fingers and eyelids appear the most frequent symptoms of hypertension &ndash; heart palpitations and high blood pressure.</p>

<p>In addition, hyperthyroidism is often a major cause of insomnia and dangerous complications of pregnancy. Pregnancy in hyperthyroidism requires mandatory compensation of the disease, because the excess hormones affect the fetus is extremely toxic and may cause his death, and various deformities.</p>

<p>Also in patients with hyperthyroidism often appears so-called &ldquo;exophthalmia&rdquo;, which creates additional problems of cosmetic nature and are often complex.</p>

<p>According to the eminent physician and scientist Botkin, the main causes of hyperthyroidism &ndash; neuro-psychiatric disorders, depression, and emotional breakdowns that disrupt the function of the thyroid gland. Hyperthyroidism is often referred to as a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; illness singers and artists because their work forces to be always &ldquo;on edge&rdquo;, a state of stress. In many patients, the disease was the primary cause psychological trauma, along with unfavorable heredity.</p>

<p>Not for nothing now, many doctors before diagnosis, are asked to make thyroid ultrasound and donate blood on hormones, because the root of many diseases lies in deviations in the thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are equally dangerous and need to see a doctor because if left untreated, these symptoms not only persist, but eventually amplified.</p>

<p>If the processing of any scratches with iodine you find traces of iodine disappear quickly (for example, for lubrication in the evening &ndash; no traces in the morning), it is likely iodine in your body is missing. And if you are, in addition, in his notice listed in this article symptoms of thyroid disease, be sure to turn in at the first opportunity blood on hormones, particularly TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone). This analysis is absolutely show, do you have any thyroid disease.</p>

<p>If there are any deviations in the analysis, then do not panic, do not be afraid to seek medical attention. Believe me, the thyroid gland is not afraid, afraid of the consequences when people are not treated. Do not be afraid &ldquo;terrible&rdquo; words hormones, having heard horror stories of incompetent people. The hormone thyroxine, which is prescribed to drink in low thyroid function, consists of only 4 atoms of iodine &ndash; as you may see, it is not, it is completely harmless.</p>

<p>Endocrinologists also argue that the more and more people nervous, the more strained his thyroid. So, do not bring your health to a critical state, all you need &ndash; to protect the nerves and the nerves of your loved ones and receive regular medical examinations, thereby maintaining their health.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://medusanews.com/images/causes-of-greasy-hair/image.jpg">http://medusanews.com/images/causes-of-greasy-hair/image.jpg</a>" width="200" height="150" title="&lsquo;Causes of greasy hair, oily hair wash, homemade mask for oily hair&rsquo; &lsquo;Homemade masks for oily hair. Proper care and cleaning oily hair&rsquo;" > Greasy hair requires frequent washing. Oily hair often lead women to despair and cause a lot of inconvenience to them that quickly gryazneyut and by the end of the day look greasy and stale, even if they are washed in the morning. But experts urge not to get upset and argue that care for them is much easier than in the dry, which, moreover, are often brittle and weakened. In addition, oily hair, thanks to the high fat content, have a huge advantage over the dry, because they, like oily skin, thanks to the natural lubrication, well protected from adverse external influences.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Causes of oily hair</h2>

<p>The main reason is the high fat content is that the sebaceous glands work too active and produce more sebum than necessary. Increased sebum secretion is often caused by genetics, but could be evidence of violations of the endocrine system.</p>

<p>In addition, increase the separation of fat intake of antibiotics, poor nutrition, extreme temperatures, severe stress and improper care. Experts believe that the right care for oily hair will avoid many of the problems and ensure that they always look nice and neat.</p>

<h2>Wash oily hair</h2>

<p>A very important question is the frequency of washing. And if you have recently called for beauticians do not wash my hair 1-2 times a week, so as not to stimulate increased zhirootdelenie, now come to the conclusion that it is much more harmful to walk with excessively oily hair. If you do not wash your hair for a long time, the upper protective layer of the scalp are beginning to proliferate microscopic fungi and yeasts that cause itching, dandruff, acne on his head and a variety of inflammatory processes. In addition, the hair follicles become clogged with fat and sebaceous ducts harden, causing the hair to stop growing, thin and hard fall.</p>

<p>Therefore, wash oily hair should be implemented as necessary, at least every day. Water for washing should not be too hot, as hot water activates the sebaceous glands. Before washing, you need to carefully comb hair &ndash; it will partially remove dirt, dandruff and protect themselves from tangling. Shampoo need not be applied directly to the hair, because in this case it is not evenly distributed.</p>

<p>It is best to dilute a small amount of shampoo to wash with water and the resulting solution, or to put it first in the palm of your hand. Lather oily hair better twice, distributing shampoo soft circular motions and without scratching the skin nails.</p>

<p>It is important to thoroughly rinse the hair after washing, because of the remnants of shampoo they are faster and have gryazneyut adhesive and matte appearance. After washing, do not immediately need to comb your hair, they need to dry out a bit. Try to use a hair dryer only when absolutely necessary, because the temperature changes are bad for oily skin and stimulate the strengthening zhirootdeleniya.</p>

<h2>Shampoo for oily hair</h2>

<p>Shampoo for oily hair should be selected very carefully, studying the composition indicated on the label. A well-chosen shampoo helps to restore proper operation of the sebaceous glands and remove the irritation and the use of the wrong shampoo will only worsen the situation. Choose a shampoo transparent natural colors &ndash; white or off-white, creamy shampoos because the bright colors often contain poisonous unnecessary and harmful dyes.</p>

<p>The most effective are the shampoos with herbal extracts &ndash; nettle, chamomile, sage, mother and stepmother, and also contain algae, vitamins A, K, C, and zinc. In the presence of dandruff shampoos choose from zinc, sulfur and tar. Do not buy shampoos, if they contain silicone, because they are heavier hair and make them even fatter.</p>

<p>Great popularity in recent years become dry shampoos that are especially useful on business trips, travel and the absence of hot water and time. These shampoos are available in powder form and are applied by spray. After 5-10 minutes, when the powder to soak up all the grease and dirt, his combed comb.</p>
