Prevention of herpes&rsquo;" > A good immune system &ndash; the best prevention of herpes. At the household level, people used to think that herpes &ndash; an ordinary &ldquo;cold&rdquo; or &ldquo;fever on the lips,&rdquo; but it is actually not so simple. Herpes (from the Greek herpes &ndash; creeping) &ndash; a viral disease that affects the mucous membranes and the skin of a person.</p>

<p>It has been known to mankind for a long time and was described by Hippocrates, who gave him the name because of the &ldquo;creeping&rdquo; nature of the spread of the disease. Among the huge number of viral diseases herpes is a leader because, according to the scientists, latent, that is hidden, &ldquo;sleeping&rdquo; form, it affects about 90% of the entire population of the planet.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are about 100 species gerpevirusa, but only eight of these are able to cause diseases in humans, the most common herpes first and second type.</p>

<h2>Herpes virus type</h2>

<p>Herpes virus (HSV-1) is passed as influenza, via droplets &ndash; coughing, sneezing and by contact with the skin or mucous membranes of an infected person. The people he called the &ldquo;common cold on the lips,&rdquo; because, though striking the whole body, outwardly manifested mainly on the lips and nose wings.</p>

<p>The first time it enters the body of the first type of herpes virus does not manifest itself clinically, people do not even realize that he is infected. Before the acute phase of the illness is called the incubation period lasting from 2 to 14 days, during which the virus is actively propagated and implemented.</p>

<p>When the virus starts to become more active on the lips appear very painful blisters with fluid, severe itching, burning, swelling, often increased body temperature and increased lymph nodes. Then the bubbles begin to burst, sores scab, which is also very painful and can last up to 10 days. After healing of wounds virus again &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; in the body and is waiting for a chance for recurrence, the timing of which can not be predicted.</p>

<p>Infection with the first type initially occurs most often between the ages of 3-4 years, and the children of the first years of life almost never get sick herpes because they have immunity from the mother, and by 5 years of age, as a rule, already have in your body  Antibodies to genital virus most often appear in adolescence, around 15 years, initially infection penetrates not only through sexual organs, but also through the mucous membranes of the mouth and skin.</p>

<p>Earlier traditionally believed that the first type of virus affects the upper part of the body &ndash; the face, mouth, eyes and lips, and the second type of virus &ndash; the lower half of the body, usually the genitals. But, now, this division is purely conditional, since there are cases genital lesions gerpevirusom first type.</p>

<h2>Herpes second type</h2>

<p>Second type of herpes virus (HSV-2), more commonly called genital because, unlike the first type, it affects mainly genital mucosa. Transmitted mainly through sex, but also there may be cases of infection through saliva, oral-genital contact. Less common infection through casual through linen and personal care products, as well as through medical procedures such as blood transfusions and organ transplants.</p>

<p>If it affects the human genital herpes incubation period ranging from 1 to 10 days, then comes the acute phase, characterized by fever, malaise, weakness and increased inguinal lymph nodes, which is extremely painful. On the genitals appear painful blisters, itching and pain. Primary genital gerpevirus can last a very long time to heal 3-5 weeks.</p>

<p>A particularly dangerous genital gerpevirus for pregnant women, because the child becomes infected it either in the womb or during childbirth when passing through an infected birth canal.  They are very common neurological disorders, blindness and death. In this regard, it is vital for women planning pregnancy, tested for the presence of viral infections to its occurrence, and if necessary undergo treatment.</p>

<p>Someone gets sick herpes every few years, and someone every few weeks, often the virus affects the same areas. And, if the first type of herpes manifests itself quite rare, mostly not more than three times a year, the second type of herpes recurrences gives every couple of months, and sometimes several times a month, delivering huge human physiological, moral and social issues. According to studies, one in two women suffering from genital gerpevirusom, lonely and Neustroev in his personal life, which often leads to depression and a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<h2>Prevention of herpes</h2>

<p>Despite the enormous prevalence of herpes, most people are passive carriers of it and only 20% of people observed symptoms. Scientists have found that the whole family gerpevirusov is our constant companion throughout life &ndash; to introduce into the body one day, they&rsquo;ll never leave. And only on the condition of the immune system depends on how the virus will behave in the body &ndash; whether it will just live quietly, without letting themselves known, or will regularly remind yourself endless recurrence.</p>

<p>From the primary contact virus gets into the bloodstream and lymph nodes, and future behavior is entirely dependent on the state of the human immune system. When good immunity develops local, or local form of herpes. If, however, reduced immunity, the virus penetrates further into the body, affecting such important organs such as the liver, kidney, spleen, adrenal glands.</p>

<p>The virus accumulates in the cells and in response to various trigger factors will periodically cause permanent relapses. It is promoted by exposure to cold, chronic fatigue, poor diet, excessive exercise, stress, alcohol, antibiotics.</p>

<p>Since the medicine of today has in its arsenal of medicines that allow to completely heal cold sores, it becomes clear that in the first place there is the problem of prevention of infections and the overall strengthening of the immune system. Protect against genital herpes, in contrast to the first type of herpes that is transmissible through airborne droplets, it is possible, respecting the rules of personal hygiene: Do not use someone else&rsquo;s lipstick, do not smoke a cigarette for two, drink, and eat only with their dishes, use a condom and do not in any way engage in oral sex if your partner has gerpevirusa blisters on the lips.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the insidious virus of the herpes host in your body and spoil your life, will make every effort to maximize strengthen your immune system and viruses then no you are not afraid. To do this, use the entire arsenal of tools for healthy living &ndash; nutrition with the presence of all necessary for the body of vitamins and minerals, the correct drinking regime, moderate exercise, healthy sleep, as well as smoking cessation and alcohol.</p>

According to doctors, with one or other signs of VSD face about 80% of people of all ages.</p>

<h2>Vegetative &ndash; dystonia symptoms and signs</h2>

<p>Vegetative (autonomic) nervous system located in the brain and spinal cord, is an essential part of the human body &ndash; it is fully coordinate the activities of all internal organs, blood vessels and glands of internal secretion and provides them to adapt with changes in the external environment.</p>

<p>In particular, the autonomic nervous system regulates blood pressure, heartbeat, body temperature, and composition of extracellular fluid volume, blood flow, metabolic rate, thirst, hunger and satiety, sweat gland function, kidney function, muscle tone internal organs, circadian (daily</p>

<p>For dystonia, which is a consequence of a breach of vascular tone, characterized by the following symptoms:</p>

<p>Neuropsychiatric &ndash; weakness, lethargy, fatigue, low efficiency, dizziness, headaches, sleep disorders, fainting, decreased sexual activity, and panic attacks;
Thermoregulatory action for breach of sweating and thermoregulation &ndash; spontaneous fever, excessive sweating, fever, flushing, or, on the contrary, sensitivity to cold extremities;
Spider &ndash; the instability of the arterial and venous pressure;
Cardiology &ndash; disruption of the heart, frequent heart contractions and pain in the heart;
Breathing (respiratory) &ndash; shortness of breath, chest tightness and a feeling of lack of air;
Dyspeptic &ndash; a disorder of the stomach &ndash; intestinal tract (constipation, diarrhea), voiding dysfunction and gallbladder dyskinesia.</p>

<h2>Vegetative &ndash; dystonia types and causes</h2>

<p>Despite the fact that the uniform classification of the IRR does not exist, the following types are divided vegetative &ndash; vascular dystonia:</p>

<p>The nature of the disease:</p>

<ul>
<li>Permanent form &ndash; occurs without abrupt jumps in the patient&rsquo;s condition;</li>
<li>Paroxysmal or paroxysmal &ndash; manifested in the form of attacks (or panic attacks crises), in the intervals between attacks manifestations of the disease are almost invisible;</li>
<li>Mixed ESP (permanently-paroxysmal) &ndash; combines the features of a permanent and paroxysmal forms;</li>
<li>Latent, or hidden form &ndash; in this type of VSD disease may not manifest themselves for quite a long time, until the trigger factors (stress, illness, fatigue).</li>
</ul>


<p>Depending on violations of cardio &ndash; vascular system:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hypertensive type or vegetative &ndash; vascular dystonia of hypertensive type. Accompanied by a significant rise in blood pressure (145/90 &ndash; 175/95 mm Hg. c.), sometimes with heart palpitations, sudden excitement, fever, symptoms of a panic attack, and, the pressure can be increased not only in times of emotional stress, but also in a state of complete rest;</li>
<li>Hypertensive type or vegetative &ndash; vascular dystonia hypotonic type. In this case, the blood pressure is substantially lower than normal and reaches 100/50 and even up to 90/45 mm Hg. Art. and is accompanied by lethargy, weakness, shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, fatigue patient, sometimes fainting;</li>
<li>Normotensive or heart (cardiac) does not depend on the type of blood pressure and heart disorders defined by the (slow heart rate, or, conversely, rapid, feelings fade and disruptions of the heart), as well as pain in the chest area;</li>
<li>Mixed type of VSD combines multiple symptoms and signs typical for any type.</li>
</ul>


<p>Depending on the cause of vegetative &ndash; vascular dystonia, the following types of VSD: genetic, infectious &ndash; allergic, traumatic, psychogenic (as a reaction to stress or traumatic situations), and arose as a result of excessive emotional or physical stress.</p>

<h2>Vegetative &ndash; dystonia treatment and prevention</h2>

<p>From the timely and correct diagnosis of VSD depends largely on the success of further treatment. If you have frequent attacks of headache, weakness, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, unfounded anxiety, fear, jumps in blood pressure and heart rate, &ldquo;lump&rdquo; in the throat, shortness of breath, pain in the heart and stomach, as well as grow cold and numb limbs &ndash;</p>

<p>Do not listen to bad advice of friends and acquaintances in an &ldquo;ESP is not a disease and will pass without treatment.&rdquo; Doctors claim that untreated dystonia is very dangerous because it can be complicated by panic attacks and other serious disorders that occur on the wrong team, the autonomic nervous system and debilitating nervous system.</p>

<p>When panic attacks (Sympathoadrenal crisis) a person starts suddenly (often in a public place) to shake, choke and breaking into a cold sweat. At the same time, he has a wild fear of death, heart pounding jumps and pressure.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://medusanews.com/images/ankylosing-spondylitis/image.jpg">http://medusanews.com/images/ankylosing-spondylitis/image.jpg</a>" width="200" height="150" title="&lsquo;Ankylosing spondylitis&rsquo; &lsquo;Ankylosing spondylitis: causes, symptoms, diagnosis&rsquo;" > Modern methods of treatment of ankylosing spondylitis help stop the inflammation of the joints. Ankylosing spondylitis, or ankylosing spondylitis (ankylosing spondylitis) &ndash; a chronic inflammatory disease of the spine and joints, accompanied by pain, stiffness and deformity and progressive ossification of the joints, including the formation of irreversible changes in them and complete immobility.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Ankylosing spondylitis causes</h2>

<p>Causes of ankylosing spondylitis is not thoroughly understood, but it is known that people who are carriers of the gene HLA-B27, a genetic predisposition to the disease Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease (BB).</p>

<p>The immune system of such people &ldquo;mistakenly&rdquo; believes tissue of the joints and ligaments, and alien attacks them, causing inflammation and damage.</p>

<p>However, even in the presence of this gene, ill ankylosing spondylitis is not all that is a mystery and the subject of further research for doctors &ndash; Rheumatology. Additional factors that may trigger the development of the disease are considered to change the immune status of the &ndash; for colds, colds, viral and infectious &ndash; allergic diseases and injuries of the pelvis and spine.</p>

<p>In addition, the latest research scientists have shown that ankylosing spondylitis is a psychosomatic illness and because, more than a third of cases the first symptoms began to appear after heavy and prolonged stress.</p>

<h2>Diagnosis and distinctive symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis</h2>

<p>Because some of the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis is very similar to the symptoms of degenerative disc disease in the early stages of these diseases are often confused, as ankylosing spondylitis often starts as a normal low back pain &ndash; pain in the lower back and painful back muscle strain.</p>

<p>Therefore, for correct diagnosis and start early treatment, it is important to identify the disease early in its development, to prevent the complete immobilization of the spine and associated threatening complications. The most dangerous complication of ankylosing spondylitis include:</p>

<p>Amyloidosis &ndash; degeneration of the kidneys, leading to kidney failure;
Defeat heart and aorta, leading to shortness of breath and chest pain provoking and disruption of the heart;
Tuberculosis and other diseases of the lung, derived from &ndash; the decrease in the mobility of the chest;
Uveitis &ndash; inflammation of the choroid, leading to blurred vision, eye pain and sensitivity to light;</p>

<p>Among the primary symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis is the most characteristic periodic pain (in 75% of cases). But if osteochondrosis pain is permanent and increases when moving, then in ankylosing spondylitis is different &ndash; the pain is much worse at night and several subside during the day, after the start of active movements.</p>

<p>If osteochondrosis person can lean on at least one side, or turn to the right &ndash; to the left, then the movement of ankylosing spondylitis usually fails in all directions. In addition, the most frequent symptom of ankylosing spondylitis is swelling and tenderness of the joints, as well as the characteristic change of posture, posture called the &ldquo;petitioner&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In the formation of an asylum patient poses a gradual straightening of the normal curvature of the spine &ndash; the back is straight and flat. A little later freezes thoracic, there is a strong slouch, and the legs when walking instinctively bend at the knees. Over time, spinal stiffness reaches such a degree that the person begins to move as if he rather inflexible spine stick.</p>

<p>Properly diagnose disease helps the spine x-ray in which an experienced physician may notice the early signs of changes of bones and joints, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a blood test for C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and the presence of the antigen HLA-B27. ESR parameter greater than 30 mm/h and the presence of HLA-B27 antigen confirm the validity of the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis.</p>

<h2>Ankylosing spondylitis treatment</h2>

<p>As the basis of therapy in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis patients assigned to longer courses (from 1 year to 5 years) of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which help to significantly slow down the progression of the disease, as well as anti-rheumatic drugs, corticosteroids, and necrosis factor blockers. Sometimes, in particularly severe cases, shows the assignment of immunosuppressive drugs.</p>

<p>In addition, it is important to sanitize all the centers of chronic infections in the body and carry out strengthening therapy &ndash; it is well to prevent cases of relapse. As an alternative treatment successfully used acupuncture, reflexology, magnet, pchelolechenie, hirudotherapy, physiotherapy and massage.</p>

<p>Girudoterapiya (leech therapy) has a good anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-bacterial effect, as contained in the saliva of leeches enzymes (hirudin, Eglin, destabilaza) soften and make more plastic stiff spine, relieve inflammation and tissue damage of the joints and ligaments, and normalize blood flow.</p>

<p>In addition, leech therapy has a beneficial effect on the entire body &ndash; by improving the blood circulation and better blood oxygen saturation, dissolve blood clots, normal metabolism, improved sleep, appetite and mood, and increases immunity.</p>

<h2>Physiotherapy</h2>

<p>Exercise therapy for ankylosing spondylitis is very important, as regular exercise and exercise increase blood flow in the joints, help maintain flexibility of the spine and lower extremities, stop the progression of the disease and prevent disability.</p>

<p>However, you should remember that exercise should be a feasible and gentle, so as not to lead to poor health. So, absolutely contraindicated in patients with BB running, jumping, shaking in the transport and hypothermia. On the contrary, it is very useful to calm walking (up to 3 &ndash; 5 kilometers), including skiing on flat terrain. Swimming in ponds and pools allowed at water temperatures below 23 &ndash; 22 degrees, and leave recommended in areas with warm and dry climate.</p>

<p>If you have a long time to be in the same position, it is necessary to change the position of each hour of the body. During the day, preferably several times to lie on a hard bed without a pillow when lying on stomach with legs straight. If this position is not straighten up, you can put a small pillow under her stomach.</p>

<p>Therapeutic exercises should be mandatory daily procedure, even if you do not feel well and have no hope of restoring spinal mobility. The fact that, due to splices and joints chest stiffness deteriorates ventilation, which may lead to pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis and other diseases. Therefore, in order to prevent serious complications, the patient is required breathing exercises (daily, 3-4 times a day, inflate a balloon) and regular walks in the fresh air.</p>

<h2>Complex physiotherapy in ankylosing spondylitis</h2>

<p>Initial position (and. etc.) &ndash; sitting on a chair.
Turns head to the right and to the left, half circles and head tilts his ear to the shoulder.
Hands on waist, shoulder blades are brought together, back straight &ndash; chin stretch ahead.
Hands separated the sides, fingers clenched in a fist &ndash; chin hug the neck and connect the blades.</p>

<p>Starting position &ndash; lying on his back
Raise your head and stretch your chin to her stomach.
Hands pull at your sides, legs join together &ndash; relying on the heel, neck and hands, lift the hips as high as possible and forecasting.
Rewound Hands behind your head, legs together, feet on yourself &ndash; lift the body by 45 degrees, a little linger in this position, and slowly lower to the starting position.
Lift straightened legs and work out them alternately in different directions circular motion.
Bend your legs, arms behind his head rewound &ndash; lift the pelvis, cave in and slowly lower.</p>

<p>Starting position &ndash; lying on its side
Both the knee to the chest, move and try to reach out to their forehead. Then straighten your legs and cave in back.
Follow alternately mahi straight leg forward &ndash; back and leg lifts straight up.
Fold the leg at the knee and follow the circular motion of the hip.</p>

<p>However, it is worth noting that the set of physical exercises can not be yourself, it must be paired with your doctor, who will take into account the individual characteristics of the course of ankylosing spondylitis and the general condition of the body.</p>

<h2>Massage, diet and prevention of complications</h2>

<p>Massage in ankylosing spondylitis, used in conjunction with physical therapy, good pain relief and muscle fatigue, strengthens the muscular system, normalizes skin tone and helps to preserve the ability of the vertebral motor.</p>

<p>However, massage is just beyond the acute phase should be easy and gentle, with no hard techniques (cutting, effleurage) and carried out by a qualified technician. The total duration of the massage treatments should not exceed 25 minutes, after the course of treatment (20 &ndash; 25 sessions) needed a break for 3 &ndash; 4 weeks.</p>

<p>Nutrition in ankylosing spondylitis, as with any other chronic inflammatory disease must be balanced, but not excessive, so as not to lead to obesity. Caloric intake should closely match the physiological needs of the body and exercise patient as overweight creates a dangerous extra strain on the joints of the spine and lower extremities.</p>

<p>In the menu there should be enough protein foods, especially fish and low-fat dairy products, salads with fresh vegetables with the addition of unrefined sunflower or corn oil, fruits and herbs. Ordinary table salt substitute on the marine containing many useful trace elements. Nutritionists advise instead of salt to add to ready-made meals seaweed powder, which contains all necessary for the normal functioning of the bones and cartilage of trace elements.</p>

<p>In addition, the diet should be excluded sharp, smoked, fried and salty foods, alcohol and refined foods, preferring healthy homemade food &ndash; whole grain porridge, stewed and pureed vegetables and soups. Doctors say if you stick to eating right, just get treatment and begin to actively engage in physical therapy, the inflammation in the joints can significantly slow down and you will be able to lead a full life.</p>
