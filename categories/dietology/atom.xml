    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/milk-diet-for-weight-loss/img.jpg" alt="Milk diet for weight loss">Everyone in their own way refers to different products. Someone like olives, some do not; someone loves caviar, and someone can not understand what&rsquo;s so special. So it is with milk: it has both fans and haters. However, in some form or other dairy products they consume almost everything and most people refer to it quite bearable. If you - among them, and want to lose a few extra kilos, you can get acquainted with several options dairy diet, which will be discussed in this post.</p>

<p>Thus, the basis of dietary food in this case is milk. And, as varieties of this product, there is quite a lot, and opinions diverge about the choice.</p>

<p>Most dieters claim that, once go on a diet, it is necessary to choose only low-fat product or a maximum of 0.5-1.5% milk, which contains only 39-47 <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/figs-diet-for-weight-loss/" title="calories">calories</a> per 100 ml. However, we advise you to seek the smallest <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/diet-aphrodite/" title="figure">figures</a>, because in the process of normalization (bringing the milk to the desired fat content), it partially loses its valuable properties. The fact that the fat-soluble vitamins useful and other components partially extracted from it, together with the &quot;surplus&quot; fats. Moreover, milk fat is not as dangerous as &quot;normal&quot; animal, which is contained in fat and fat meat. Its main components are useful phospholipids rather than potentially threatening <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/cardiology/atherosclerosis.html" title="atherosclerosis">atherosclerosis</a> <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/when-to-calibrate-their-cholesterol-triglyceride-and-hdl-cholesterol/" title="cholesterol">cholesterol</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, you can not pay so much attention to the choice of issues. Will suit you like milk with 1.5%, and the &quot;standard&quot;, with 2.5% fat content, which can be found in every store. Although, of course, if you do opt for the 6% of the product or liquid cream, it is unlikely to benefit figure.</p>

<p><strong>As milk diet effect on the body?</strong></p>

<p>This in itself has a low calorie milk and contains small amounts of protein required in the diet body. Actually, that&rsquo;s all, what are its advantages when it comes to <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/watermelon-diet/" title="weight loss">weight loss</a>. Fat is not mobilized, a depressing effect on the appetite does not, on the blood sugar level is not affected. It&rsquo;s just a useful product small calorie, which can be used as a dietary. The effect of a diet is to ensure that the diet is severely limited energy value.</p>

<p>Itself milk diet, in whatever form it is employed, is rigid and is usually not perfectly balanced, so it is not recommended for a long time.</p>

<h2>Types of milk diet</h2>

<p>If we approach the issue of transfer of dairy diet with all the responsibility, you can find a dozen different versions of it, in which as the dominant power component acts milk. But the most commonly used are 3 types.</p>

<p>It is intended for use during the day (as the handling of the day), the most healthy people are allowed to use it for 3 days. On day <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/how-to-lose-weight-at-home/" title="slimming">slimming</a> offered 1 liter of milk; moreover, it can drinking ordinary water and mineral. That is, in fact, mono-diet on milk is <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/starvation.html" title="starvation">starvation</a>.</p>

<p>During the day it takes about 500-700 g of weight, three days you can lose up to 2 kg. But, in any case, it requires the observance of the human ideal health, and sit on it longer than strictly prohibited.</p>

<p>By the choice of food it can be characterized as a protein, because during its compliance permitted only various embodiments of dairy products. You can drink milk, yogurt, fermented baked low-fat, low-fat cottage cheese has, diet cheese, unsweetened yogurt. Glazed cheese, ice cream, yoghurt, sweet, cream, sour cream - all this, of course, prohibited.</p>

<p>Ingestion performed 5-6 times per day total caloric intake calculated individually for women - not less than 1200 kcal, if it is supposed to adhere for 1 week, and not less than 1500 kcal, when it is planned to extend for 14 days.</p>

<p>Longer &quot;sitting&quot; on the expanded dairy diet is contraindicated, since such power marked a clear shortage of fats and carbohydrates, which can lead to adverse effects on the part of health. As for the results, then a week on it, you can lose about 2-3 kg.</p>

<p>From the listed options for the most useful and safe. It consists in the fact that, along with the milk (1-1.5 liters per day), a person is allowed to eat fresh fruits and vegetables, salads and boiled or baked vegetables. Excluded are only those plant foods that contain too much sugar and starch (corn, potatoes, grapes). Should be fed 4-6 times a day, calculated calorie in the same manner as the previous embodiment diet.</p>

<p>Since vegetables and fruits generally lower in calories than the milk-based products, the amount of power becomes greater, and diet quite easily tolerated. But more than 2 weeks of her stay is not necessary, you need to take a break for at least 10 days. And another recommendation: if you are planning a meal with the addition of fresh fruits and vegetables, do not drink milk immediately after use, it is better do it in an hour and a half. Due to the high acid content in vegetable products in such a combination may cause <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/symptoms/diarrhea.html" title="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/diet-aphrodite/img.jpg" alt="Diet Aphrodite">In Greek mythology, Aphrodite - the goddess of love and <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/nine-day-diet/" title="beauty">beauty</a>. Therefore its name is often referred to as a <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/watermelon-diet/" title="weight loss">weight loss</a> diet, as an integral feature of female attractiveness is a slim figure. Variants of Aphrodite, there are many diets. Most often, the so-called power scheme, which is based on the use of Mediterranean cuisine.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Menu Diet Aphrodite is strongly reminiscent of a Mediterranean menu. Eat only a useful and <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/pineapple-diet/" title="health">health</a>y food. Carbohydrates, which are the direct cause of <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="obesity">obesity</a>, severely limit. The source of fats are fish, seafood, and vegetable oils, which are allowed to be added to vegetable salads.</p>

<ol>
<li>The diet of many fish and seafood.</li>
<li>It is recommended to the regular inclusion of seaweed menu.</li>
<li>Shrimp - one of the basic diet products. They need to eat at least twice a week, and if it allows the thickness of the purse, then more often.</li>
<li>Chicken should be a priority meats.</li>
<li>Lactic acid products need to drink before bedtime.</li>
<li>Allowed to eat eggs, but it is recommended to separate the yolk - it has a lot of fat.</li>
<li>In many dishes is recommended to add the celery.</li>
<li>Fruits and juices can be drunk in unlimited quantities.</li>
<li>Sweets and flour products are excluded from the diet.</li>
<li>Cereals and bread can be eaten only in the morning.</li>
</ol>


<p>In this embodiment Aphrodite diet has no restrictions on duration, caloric intake, the number of meals. But to know the measure, of course, necessary. Despite the dominance of the diet of protein foods and vegetables, plump with overeating can even be on these products.</p>

<h2>Diet Aphrodite with goat cheese</h2>

<p>The Internet is widely distributed another version of Aphrodite&rsquo;s diet with goat cheese. She is short, only lasts three days and is designed for <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/how-to-lose-weight-at-home/" title="rapid weight loss">rapid weight loss</a>. Menu of such a diet is clearly laid out by day. Power - Four.</p>

<p><strong>The first day:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Goat cheese - 100g of bread - 50 g.</li>
<li>A glass of yogurt.</li>
<li>Soup, which consists of mushrooms, cucumber, goat cheese and olive oil.</li>
<li>Vegetables and Goat Cheese.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Second day:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Oatmeal and dried fruits.</li>
<li>A glass of yogurt and an apple.</li>
<li>Vegetables and shrimp.</li>
<li>Goat cheese and scrambled eggs with tomatoes.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Day Three:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Egg, cucumber, 100 g of goat cheese.</li>
<li>100 grams of cottage cheese, a piece of fruit.</li>
<li>Goat cheese with mushrooms.</li>
<li>Vegetables.</li>
</ol>


<p>With such a diet can really lose weight. However, to do it for three days is not possible, but it is not designed for a long life. Therefore, a diet of Aphrodite on the goat cheese is unlikely to radically change your figure.</p>

<h2>Greek diet Aphrodite</h2>

<p>Probably the most stupid diet should be considered as the Greek Aphrodite. It is designed for weight loss, but the diet based on - carbohydrates, while protein-containing foods is limited. Menu options Aphrodite Greek diet consists mainly of:</p>

<ul>
<li>vegetables;</li>
<li>cereals;</li>
<li>pasta;</li>
<li>fruits;</li>
<li>nuts and seeds;</li>
<li>dairy products;</li>
<li>of bread;</li>
<li>legumes;</li>
<li>olive oil;</li>
<li>wine.</li>
</ul>


<p>These foods should be consumed daily. An intermediate position is occupied by the food recommended to be put on the table, no more frequently than every other day:</p>

<ul>
<li>honey;</li>
<li>chocolate;</li>
<li>seafood;</li>
<li>a fish;</li>
<li>eggs.</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, in the least favored by the creators of the meat of the Greek diet. Oil-rich generally prohibited. But chicken or veal to use as possible, but not more than three times a month. What thoughts <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/why-should-you-run-benefits-and-harms-of-running/" title="running">running</a> through my head of people who compose this diet, we do not know. But if you do not want to multiply the fat reserves on your stomach, it is better to give it up.</p>

<h2>Menu watermelon diet for 3 days</h2>

<p>The main thing for this diet - a strict limit of watermelon consumption depending on the initial weight. For example, if you weigh 70 kg, then the day you can eat no more than 7 kg of watermelon. That is, 10 kg of 1 kg is allowed watermelon.</p>

<p>Nothing else is allowed to eat, but you can drink as much as you want. Allowed to drink water, and green tea in any amount. Alcohol should be excluded completely.</p>

<p>The diet of this diet is not as hard as in the first case. It is allowed in addition to watermelon to eat at each meal 2 slices of rye bread. Follow the diet should be 8-10 days. Other products can not eat.</p>

<p>Not recommended to follow this diet for more than 10 days, but if it is right to go out of it, you can significantly improve your score. To do this, proteins were gradually introduced into the menu, fats and carbohydrates, but only gradually, not otherwise. Before going to bed for an additional 10 days to eat a few slices of watermelon, but not much. Do not have dinner after 20.00. If you eat right for another 10 days, you can lose weight by 2-3 kg, but not as rapidly as during a diet, but the result will be more stable.</p>

<li>diet normalizes metabolism.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Cons watermelon diet:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>the first and most important negative - it is a contraindication to watermelon diet for kidney and urinary tract;</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/model-diet/img.jpg" alt="Model diet">Judging by the name, the model diet is intended for the purchase of model appearance. However, judging by its duration, it is unlikely to reach its goal. Model Diet is one of the short circuit power to lose weight. In one embodiment, it takes 3 days, in another - 7 days. Let&rsquo;s get acquainted with them.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Model diet for 3 days</h2>

<p>It is unlikely that the model used the diet, which will be discussed. Rather, they use a more healthy ways to lose weight under the supervision of doctors. But the title of this three-day supply circuit stuck. diet menu model for 3 days as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Breakfast</strong> - one boiled egg or boiled;</li>
<li><strong>Dinner</strong> - 300 g of raw vegetables, can be in the form of salad, 2 fruit, 100 g of fish steamed.</li>
</ul>


<script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>


<!-- post_first -->


<p><ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-8970873924341937"

</script></p>

<p>Impossible to lose weight in 3 days at this menu. For such a short period of time at all you can not change the contours of the figure. Model diet limits caloric intake, but not so much that people lost weight. In addition, in the evening the candidates in the model are invited to taste the bread and butter, which violates several rules of diet.</p>

<p>Usually carbohydrates are consumed in the morning, so the body can use them up during the day. But the model diet allows you to eat an egg for breakfast only, half-day so people have to embarrass colleagues his rumbling stomach. In the evening, a candidate in the model would be a good idea to eat a light dinner consisting mainly of proteins and containing a minimum of <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/figs-diet-for-weight-loss/" title="calories">calories</a>. But no, he eats a calorie sandwich with butter, consisting of fats and carbohydrates.</p>

<p>Perhaps, it is possible to lose a few kilos for a month on a model diet. But so long it withstand very difficult. Besides, it is designed only for 3 days. During this time, you will surely not be able to buy a model appearance.</p>

<p>But there is another version of the diet. It is a hard and probably reduces the weight even by removal of bowel contents. If you need to urgently improve the shape of your abdomen, you can use the following diet:</p>

<p><strong>Dinner (no later than 15 hours)</strong> - 100 grams of cottage cheese.</p>

<p>Diet is very difficult. It is harmful to health and brings only a temporary effect. Therefore it is better to pay attention to diet to lose weight at the expense of allowing the splitting of fat, rather than create the illusion of a flat stomach as a result of bowel emptying.</p>

<h2>Model diet for 7 days</h2>

<p>The seven-day model diet is more forgiving than both variants diet for 3 days. It involves three meals a day. Menu is very flexible. Low calorie diet, the amount of food is small. But the model diet for 7 days makes it possible to more or less normal breakfast, lunch and even dinner.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Breakfast</strong> - a small piece of boiled meat, two eggs, bread and butter, tea;</li>
<li><strong>Lunch</strong> - fish or meat (no more than 100 g), 2 fruit, 250-300 g of vegetable salad with green peas;</li>
<li><strong>Dinner</strong> - a salad of green vegetables (300 g), two slices of bread and butter.</li>
</ul>


<p>Throughout the diet should drink water. It is advisable before each meal consumed green tea - at least one glass at a time. Additional fluid can overcome hunger.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have a diet rapid analysis. Obviously, the base diet - a protein-containing products and vegetables. One would assume that the diet allows you to lose weight by restricting carbohydrates. But one day a person eats three slices of bread with butter and two pieces of fruit, which, although they do not have a high-calorie, contain simple sugars. This limitation is not enough sugar to lose weight, even if the diet is observed for months.</p>

<p>However, it is likely that a person will be able to get rid of a small amount of fat due to the low calorie diet. Because dense foods on the menu only oil is present. But it is not enough - only a few grams. The relatively high nutritional value has bread. The rest of the food - it is vegetables, fruits, lean meat, eggs and fish. These products are considered useful for the figure.</p>

<p>Energy value of the daily diet is about 1000 kcal. Perhaps it will suffice to the amount of fat in your body has decreased by 0.5-1 kg. It is unlikely in the model diet for only 7 days you will be able to lose weight more. If you cut off a huge loaf of bread instead of a small piece, and inflict on him the oil layer two inches thick, you soon get better than that reduce weight.</p>
