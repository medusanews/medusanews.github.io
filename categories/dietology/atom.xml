These substances in a given amount contains almost any food and are called macronutrients. And why do we need them?</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Proteins - building blocks for all body cells. They are composed of <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/for-what-needed-amino-acids/" title="amino acids">amino acids</a>, which are divided into essential and nonessential. Interchangeable can be synthesized in humans only essential to reach a food composition. Proteins are necessary for growth, development, and in general for any physiological process; thus, they are absolutely safe in terms of possible accumulation of excess weight. The sources of protein are meat, fish, dairy products and legumes.</p>

Fats - are made up of fatty acids, which are divided into saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. Today at all on hearing beneficial omega-3 and omega-6 acids, belonging to the group of polyunsaturated and can lower <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/when-to-calibrate-their-cholesterol-triglyceride-and-hdl-cholesterol/" title="cholesterol">cholesterol</a>. It is also necessary for the absorption of fats, vitamins, synthesis of a number of hormones, the normal operation of many systems of the body. They are contained in both animal food (meat, fish, dairy products) and plant (nuts, seeds, vegetable oil) origin. Excessive consumption of fat - a way to lose the harmony.</p>

<p>Carbohydrates - the main source of energy. They can be simple (glucose, sucrose, etc.) and complex (cellulose, glycogen). Splitting of carbohydrates gives the body energy, the unspent portion of which can be converted into body fat. The main sources of carbohydrates - fruits, vegetables, cereals and sweets.</p>

<p>The diet of an adult to maintain its health and permanent weight gain there should be a certain ratio of these nutrients. Thus, our daily menu should contain:</p>

<p>Once in the digestive system, proteins, fats and carbohydrates are exposed cleavage with release of energy necessary for vital processes. The resulting energy is measured in units - kilocalories (kcal), which, for brevity, often referred to as calories.</p>

<p>Energy value of macronutrients varies. 1 gram of carbohydrate and protein is cleaved to release 4 kcal, 1 gram of fat - 9 kcal.</p>

<h2>Caloric intake and the ratio of macronutrients for weight loss</h2>

<p>Weight person depends on how many calories enters the body, and how much is consumed. If these amounts are approximately equal, the mass remains stable. If it receives more calories than consumed energy postponed &quot;in reserve&quot; in the form of fat.</p>

<p>Accordingly, to reduce weight, it is necessary to spend more calories than is consumed with food.</p>

<p>To calculate daily calorie your diet and calculate the necessary amount of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, using a few simple formulas. Try to make the calculations for yourself using these formulas and examples.</p>

<p><strong><em>1. First you need to calculate your basal metabolism.</em></strong></p>

<p>For women: 655 + (9,6 x weight in kg) + (height x 1,8 cm) - (4,7 x age);</p>

<p>For men: 66 + (13.7 x weight in kg) + (5 x height in cm) - (6.76 x age).</p>

<p>For example, take a woman 30 years Height 165 cm and weight 65 kg.</p>

<p>Its main exchange will be equal to: 655 + (9.6 x 65) + (1.8 x 165) - (4.7 x 30) = 655 + 624 + 297 - 141 = 1435 kcal/day.</p>

<p><strong><em>2. Next you need to determine your level of activity, as measured by the coefficient of activity:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Inactive (complete absence or rare sports activity) - 1.2;</li>
<li>Sedentary (light load 1-3 times a week) - 1,375;</li>
<li>Medium (load average 3-5 days a week) - 1.55;</li>
<li>Very active (full load 6-7 days a week) - 1,725;</li>
<li>Hyperactive (very high physical activity and physical work 7 days a week) - 1.9.</li>
</ul>


<p>For example, our woman working in the office, mostly sedentary work, to which she gets in transport. However, it is housekeeping, she loves to go shopping and sometimes wanders into a fitness club. So, its activity coefficient - 1.375.</p>

<p><strong><em>3. Now you need to determine daily intake of calories by the formula:</em></strong></p>

<p>The main metabolic activity coefficient x.</p>

<p>In our example, it is 1435 kcal/day x 1.375 = 1973 kcal/day.</p>

<p><strong><em>4. By subtracting from the resulting figure of 500 kcal, we get the amount of calories that we need to consume to lose weight.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>5. In order not to drive themselves in such rigid framework, calculate the so-called &quot;corridor calories&quot; by the formulas:</em></strong></p>

<p>Energy intake for <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/gone-month-after-weight-loss-how-to-restore-the-month-following-the-diet/" title="weight loss">weight loss</a> - 250 = lower limit</p>

<p>Kalorazh <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/how-to-lose-weight-at-home/" title="slimming">slimming</a> +100 = upper limit.</p>

<p>That is, our women to lose weight, you need to keep your calorie daily diet within the 1223 - 1573 kcal/day.</p>

<p>In these calculations, it is important to remember that the daily calorie intake for women should not be lower than 1200 kcal. Calories less than this figure have a negative impact on health. 1200 calories a day - it is also very small, so it is better to consume more calories. Keeping within the corridor of calories, you will still lose weight.</p>

<p>To do this, go back to their energy capacity and percentage in the daily diet - 10-25% protein, 20-35% fat and 45-65% carbohydrates. And calculate what proportion they should take, given the upper and lower limit of the corridor calories.</p>

<p>For our example, it will have the following meanings:</p>

<p>So, to lose weight, a woman from the example should be consumed in a day 30.5 - 98 g protein, 27 - 61 grams of fat and 137.5 - 256 grams of carbohydrates.</p>

<p>Of course, this is a rough estimate, and these amounts are not necessarily comply with the accuracy of a tenth of a unit.</p>

<h2>Another obstacle on the road to weight loss</h2>

<p>We hope you have successfully reached the end of the calculations, and now in front of you is a piece of the figures, which you will need to make your diet. And how to be? Here begins the next portion of the complexities. In light of almost no foods which comprise only proteins, but only fats or carbohydrates - all products are mixed with a predominance of certain compounds. So 100 grams of meat is not equivalent to 100 grams of protein. And try to lead your diet in perfect match with the results of your arithmetic exercises you do not succeed.</p>

<p>The daily diet of a person must be present all the major macronutrients. Refusal or severely restricting some of them have a negative impact on your health and well-being. On the other hand, every person is different, and the need for those or other substances may also differ.</p>

<p>Counting the number of proteins, fats and carbohydrates - only one of many ways to achieve harmony and health. However, while one of the most difficult to execute. So it is not necessarily strictly follow it. You will achieve no less results if just eat varied, trying to eat less animal fat and sweets. And freed from the complex calculations time you can spend more usefully: first - on a visit to the gym, and then - to update the wardrobe&hellip;</p>

About the egg we discussed in great detail, the time came to light the principles cheese Maggi, which enjoys enough popular among people who want to lose weight.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It can be described as: a low-calorie, low-fat, low-carb, high-protein. At first glance, perfect, containing no food components, is converted into fat, and includes only the necessary nutrients for life. In general, this diet is really very effective and, importantly, not &quot;hungry&quot;, but it has its drawbacks, which we will touch upon later.</p>

Diet lasts 4 weeks, and during this time you need to follow a well-defined menu, which occupies a central place cottage cheese. Excesses and going beyond the list of approved products is prohibited; not recommended even pick up food analogues suggested, for example, replace the chicken. If the menu designated fruit or vegetables, among the first need not <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/choosing-a-anti-stretch-marks-cream-after-giving-birth/" title="choose">choose</a> sweet (grape, melon, dried fruit, bananas), and among the second preference amyloid (especially potatoes).</p>

<p>Be sure to drink at least two liters of fluid per day; it can be tea, coffee, mineral water. Sweetening drinks, of course, impossible.</p>

<p>Creator warned that the slightest deviation from the prescribed diet - and diet does not work, stop ubavka weight, kilograms and then come back, so that any failure of supposedly required to start a diet again. We can not say that this statement seems to be true; This is likely just some measure of deterrence, which raises awareness at losing weight and motivates them to the strict implementation of the rules of cottage cheese diet Maggie. But in fact, rare and small errors in the menu do not carry such harm, as promised harsh author so casually allowing freedom in the diet, it is not necessary to return to the menu, the first day of the diet and then resign ourselves to a month of severe deprivation. This is not only pointless, but for some people may not be useful, given the kind of load on the body creates a <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/protein-diet-sample-menu-protein-diet/" title="protein diet">high-protein diet</a> either.</p>

<h2>Reviews and Results</h2>

<p>As already mentioned, the diet is in great demand - first of all, because it allows us to achieve significant results.

If it appears moderately and fatigue does not apply to daily activities, do not pay attention to it: a little lack of energy against the backdrop of high-protein food is natural and expected. That it brings you as little as possible of experiences, choose those kinds of loads, which are easier for you, such as <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/why-should-you-run-benefits-and-harms-of-running/" title="jogging">jogging</a> or swimming breaststroke instead of strength training.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://medusanews.com/images/for-what-needed-amino-acids/img.jpg" title="For what needed amino acids?" alt="amino acids, how to make amino acids, amino acids for weight loss, essential amino acids, amino acids for muscle growth, what are amino acids">Amino acids - are chemical compounds that comprise proteins. When the human digestive tract gets protein foods, using special enzymes, it is split into amino acids. Only then it can be assimilated. Small-sized molecules penetrate the amino acids from the intestine into the blood, and then the body can use them for their own purposes.</p>

<p>Amino acids perform many important functions in the body. They can be divided into plastic and energy. Plastic functions are built from amino acids of the protein molecules that make up all the tissues of our body. Because amino acids are not only bodies, but also biologically active substances: enzymes, certain hormones, neurotransmitters. The energy function is the splitting of the amino acids in order to release energy.</p>

<p>To maintain human life he needed only 20 species of amino acids, although they exist in nature much more. They are divided into three groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interchangeable - can be synthesized in the body from chemical compounds having a non-protein origin;</li>
<li>Conditionally replaceable - are synthesized in a limited number;</li>
<li>Essential - are not synthesized in the body.</li>
</ul>


<p>Man receives daily amino acids from food. Most of them are found in meat, fish, eggs, milk and other animal products. The richest vegetable source of protein is soy and other legumes, but they contain less essential amino acids.</p>

<h2>What are amino acids common man?</h2>

<p>Everyone needs amino acids. None of these chemical compounds, we can not synthesize protein. If the amino acids are no longer come from the outside, the body begins to break down its own tissues and organs, to compensate for their deficits. The absence of even one essential amino acid in the human diet leads to severe disease.</p>

<p>The source of these materials were previously only foods. Today amino acids produced by many pharmaceutical companies as supplements or drugs. Some of them are designed for the treatment of certain diseases, others are used by athletes to build muscle. With the purpose of treatment of amino acids into the reception - this is an expensive and inefficient pleasure.</p>

<p>There are many medications on the basis of amino acids, which are used for parenteral nutrition patients. If a person can not eat food alone, he poured the amino acid solutions intravenously. Often because of these drugs the doctors save patient lives, as in the period of severe illness when the body&rsquo;s plastic processes are active, the body needs protein more than usual.</p>

<h2>What are amino acids during training?</h2>

<p>Most athletes who are engaged in bodybuilding, taking protein powders. They use it as an additional source of protein to build muscle mass quickly. Alternatively the protein amino acid solutions are applied. Pharmaceutical companies argue that they are more effective than the protein obtained from food as well as familiar to most athletes protein powders.</p>

<p>True or not? Most companies that produce amino acids for athletes, convince us of the veracity of this information. But their interest is obvious: the amino acids of the protein are much more expensive, so bring more income from sales. For the successful promotion of the product on the market was invented so-called &quot;protein window&quot; or &quot;protein corridor&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Protein box&quot; - a period of time after the workout, which is considered optimal for protein <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/how-to-reduce-the-acidity-of-the-stomach/" title="digestion">digestion</a>. It is 40-50 minutes. During this period the athlete should learn the most protein to gain muscle growth. If the late bodybuilder, muscles will grow more slowly. But the protein from foods like protein powders, slowly digested, so the athlete has only one chance to catch up to the closing &quot;window of protein&quot;. To do this, take the amino acid solution.</p>

<p>Unlike the protein, amino acids absorbed from the intestine immediately without pretreatment with proteolytic enzymes. Their concentration in the blood rises sharply after 15-20 minutes after taking the supplements. Thus, a person has time to deliver the amino acids in muscle, while &quot;protein window&quot; remains open.</p>

<p>It is quite logical to study the benefits of amino acids in protein loved athletes. Very often in the specialized literature for bodybuilders can find information about the &quot;protein window&quot;. But studies have shown that intake of protein and amino acids provides identical results athletes during training. &quot;Protein window&quot; hardly exists, although the myth about him still wanders from book to book, stimulating the sale of free amino acids.</p>

<p>BCAA - three amino acids, most commonly used in the training. These include isoleucine, valine and leucine. It is these amino acids are part of the majority of sports supplements for bodybuilders. The main effects of BCAA:</p>

<ul>
<li>The accelerated build-up of muscle mass;</li>
<li>Increasing strength athlete;</li>
<li>Reduction of body fat mass.</li>
</ul>


<p>There is no doubt the benefits of BCAA bodybuilder. With them he will reach sports results. They are rapidly absorbed and have high bioavailability, are easy to use. But the lack of supplements based on amino acids BCAA is the price. They are expensive, but a similar result can be obtained by an athlete using whey protein.</p>

<p>Amino BCAA available in different dosage forms. There capsules and solutions, but less likely to take the supplement in powder form. It is recognized that the powder is less convenient to use: it is poorly soluble in the liquid and has a bitter taste. Ready amino acid solutions are tastier, more convenient to use and transport, but are more expensive.</p>

<p>Take BCAA recommended 1 teaspoon (4-5 grams), from 1 to 3 times a day. Amino acids are allowed to be combined with any other sports nutrition. Of course, it makes no sense to take them together with protein, since these additives have the same mechanism of action, although some people do it to save money.</p>

<p>Amino acids - are chemical substances, of which built all the proteins in our body. A person must receive them regularly with food to stay healthy. Athletes who are building up the muscles need additional source of amino acids. Especially important for them leucine, valine, isoleucine, which are abbreviated as BCAA. Supplements containing amino acids, convenient to use and easily digested. However, they are expensive, so as a source of amino acids most athletes use a cheaper but equally effective protein powder.</p>

It is considered a source of balance. Therapeutic effects: replenishes blood levels, nourishing yin, expels wind, strengthens weakened, normalizes the activity of the channels of stomach and spleen. In Russia, black soybeans also find healing, but its effect is usually described using different terminology, more understandable to our man.</p>

<p>Black soybean useful in exactly the same extent that and soy white or yellow. This is a common legume has a high protein content and insoluble dietary fiber. There is hardly any sense to use it as a medicine. Black soybean much more suitable for use in food. Nevertheless, she decided to attribute the following useful properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Normalizes nervous activity;</li>
<li>Cures cancer (probably not in the world of plants, which it does not cure, according to admirers of traditional medicine);</li>
<li>To protect people from the harmful effects of the environment;</li>
<li>Reduces the level of <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/when-to-calibrate-their-cholesterol-triglyceride-and-hdl-cholesterol/" title="cholesterol">cholesterol</a> in the blood;</li>
<li>Promotes weight loss.</li>
</ul>


<p>All these inventions. This can be read on virtually any product of plant origin. Perhaps black soy and healthy if its systematic use in food, but cancer or diabetes, it is certainly not cures.</p>

<p>Black soybean contains no toxic compounds for the organism. The damage is only possible with overeating or the presence of diseases of the digestive system. Disadvantages of the product:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>High calorie</strong> - do not pass at a weight problem;</li>
<li><strong>High fiber content</strong> - possible bloating, changes in the frequency and stool consistency;</li>
<li><strong>Small size, dense texture, slippery edge</strong> - a man with a deficit of intelligence can strangle if Bob gets into the respiratory tract.</li>
</ul>


<p>People with normal mental development and good health black soybeans can not hurt anything. Eat without fear for their health.</p>

<p>On the Internet a lot of popularity gained supplement for weight loss called &quot;black soybeans&quot;. The advertisement says that it is delivered directly from Japan. It is not clear why they are doing, because it is a good idea in Russia is growing.</p>

<p>At sells website reported that the secret of longevity of the Japanese, finally revealed! It turns out the high life expectancy - a consequence of regular consumption of black soya.</p>

<p>Take supplements you offer for the following purposes:</p>

<p><strong>1. Weight Loss.</strong> The main purpose of black soya. Weight reduction is due to increasing the activity of fat cells. Those allegedly begin to burn fat, regardless of the amount of food consumed by you, including, if you have no physical activity. In addition, thanks to soy protein, according to advertising, the muscles grow without any training.
<strong>2. Improvement by saturating the body with useful substances.</strong> The site Product asserts that certain vitamins, minerals and amino acids are contained only in black soybeans. Nowhere in nature, they are no more. I wonder what kind of minerals are? If you would like Mendeleev heard, he probably would have got out of the coffin to burn his table of chemical elements.
<strong>3. Rejuvenation.</strong> It is due to dietary fiber (which, incidentally, are in any plant food). The body is rejuvenated as a result of lightning elimination of toxins under the influence of black soy from Japan. After that, according to the suppliers of goods, there is a surge of energy forces in the cell, and you feel much better.</p>

<p>Due to what effect this wonder-drug that reduces weight and rejuvenate the body? If you believe the official site, as part contains the following components:</p>

<p><strong>Proteins.</strong> Present in any food products. They are a source of calories. Promote weight loss, but only if used in place of fatty and sugary foods, not in addition to it.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamins A and E.</strong> So these vitamins, which are found nowhere else in nature, except for black soy! Or is there? Yes, still there. Vitamin A is full in carrots and other yellow vegetables, and vitamin E in abundance found in vegetable oils. Both components are useful for health, weight loss but not in any way contribute.</p>

<p><strong>B vitamins</strong> are present in many other foods. Good for your health, but they do not lose weight and look younger.</p>

<p><strong>Alimentary fiber.</strong> In fact contribute to weight loss. But only if the abundance of dietary fiber in the diet causes decrease in consumption of other foods. By themselves, they do not burn fat.</p>

<p><strong>Amino acids.</strong> This protein structural components, so that in fact when transferring the composition manufacturer repeats the same material twice. As mentioned above, from the proteins do not lose weight if they are a supplement, not a substitute for the usual ration.</p>

<p><strong>Trace elements.</strong> What kind of minerals are in the black soybeans - the manufacturer is not recognized. Given that nowhere in other products do not, in general, these micronutrients to mankind is not known, to evaluate their real impact on the shape and health is very difficult.</p>

<p>Black soybean are sold as a concentrate. You will receive a jar of powder. It must be diluted in a glass of water and drink before each meal, three times a den.Takoe use of black soya will help in weight loss, as it will reduce appetite.</p>

<p>Of course, this will not happen because of the presence of this plant amazing fat-burning properties. Hunger subsides as the day before the meal in the stomach will be less space. As a result, you eat less. If this happens regularly for at least several months, you will eventually be able to normalize the figures.</p>

<p>Black soybeans - is one of hundreds or thousands of useless goods for figure and health that is actively circulating on the Internet. It pacifiers in a beautiful package. They are sold on the colorfully decorated sites and skillfully advertised, but because demand. Nevertheless, the man who would be able to lose weight and rejuvenate with the help of black soybean, the world does not know.</p>

Sample menu protein diet" alt="Protein diet">The most common protein diet try to choose those who are engaged in fitness, or who can not give up meat and fish, but calmly dispenses with flour and sweet.</p>

<p>The basic idea of protein diets is that we create a shortage of carbohydrates in the body, are considered the main source of energy for the organism. As a result, the metabolism starts to rebuild, and the body will consume fat.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The bulk of the protein diet involves almost complete rejection of carbohydrate foods, and consumption of products containing large amounts of protein.</p>

The diet protein diet usually includes meat and fish, eggs, cottage cheese, yogurt and low-fat cheeses.</p>

<p>Sometimes, for example, egg diet, the diet can include citrus fruits (grapefruit, oranges, and the like), which are positioned as a source of vitamins.</p>

<p>The main disadvantage of all protein diets - it is unbalanced diet.</p>

<h2>We can not exclude carbohydrates completely!</h2>

<p>For weight loss on the protein diet is usually used following recommendations may be included on the menu only lean chicken, fish, egg whites and low-fat cottage cheese (it is desirable to have 4 meals, at a time that the output of 25-30 g of protein) and a drink sugar and other products should be deleted (except Citrus).</p>

<p>This menu can not be considered a balanced&hellip; In most cases the authors of these methods is recommended to keep a diet for 2 weeks, ostensibly for &quot;changes in metabolism&quot;. In practice, the rejection of carbohydrates is harmful to the body. The complete absence of ñontaining carbohydrates foods in the diet and an excess of junk food can cause ketosis (increased content of ketone bodies in the tissues of the body).</p>

<p>Ketosis is a kind of unmistakable indication that the process of lipolysis. Reach ketosis state - the main goal of many low-carb diets.</p>

<p>Typically ketosis appears when the amount of carbohydrates is less than 100 grams per day. In some people, ketosis occurs only with reducing carbohydrates to 40 g per day.</p>

<p>To determine the presence of ketone bodies can use the urine test.</p>

<p>Some authors protein diets claim that the complete rejection of carbohydrates - a necessary condition for weight loss, because ketosis state body draws its energy mainly from the fat reserves.</p>

<p>It is believed that the ketogenic diet is very harmful and even dangerous for your health. Indeed, the ketogenic diet can be dangerous, it all depends on the individual person&rsquo;s health status.</p>

<p><strong>However, current research tells us this:</strong></p>
