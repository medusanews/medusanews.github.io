It is considered a source of balance. Therapeutic effects: replenishes blood levels, nourishing yin, expels wind, strengthens weakened, normalizes the activity of the channels of stomach and spleen. In Russia, black soybeans also find healing, but its effect is usually described using different terminology, more understandable to our man.</p>

<p>Black soybean useful in exactly the same extent that and soy white or yellow. This is a common legume has a high protein content and insoluble dietary fiber. There is hardly any sense to use it as a medicine. Black soybean much more suitable for use in food. Nevertheless, she decided to attribute the following useful properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Normalizes nervous activity;</li>
<li>Cures cancer (probably not in the world of plants, which it does not cure, according to admirers of traditional medicine);</li>
<li>To protect people from the harmful effects of the environment;</li>
<li>Reduces the level of <a href="http://medusanews.com/articles/when-to-calibrate-their-cholesterol-triglyceride-and-hdl-cholesterol/" title="cholesterol">cholesterol</a> in the blood;</li>
<li>Promotes weight loss.</li>
</ul>


<p>All these inventions. This can be read on virtually any product of plant origin. Perhaps black soy and healthy if its systematic use in food, but cancer or diabetes, it is certainly not cures.</p>

<p>Black soybean contains no toxic compounds for the organism. The damage is only possible with overeating or the presence of diseases of the digestive system. Disadvantages of the product:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>High calorie</strong> - do not pass at a weight problem;</li>
<li><strong>High fiber content</strong> - possible bloating, changes in the frequency and stool consistency;</li>
<li><strong>Small size, dense texture, slippery edge</strong> - a man with a deficit of intelligence can strangle if Bob gets into the respiratory tract.</li>
</ul>


<p>People with normal mental development and good health black soybeans can not hurt anything. Eat without fear for their health.</p>

<p>On the Internet a lot of popularity gained supplement for weight loss called &quot;black soybeans&quot;. The advertisement says that it is delivered directly from Japan. It is not clear why they are doing, because it is a good idea in Russia is growing.</p>

<p>At sells website reported that the secret of longevity of the Japanese, finally revealed! It turns out the high life expectancy - a consequence of regular consumption of black soya.</p>

<p>Take supplements you offer for the following purposes:</p>

<p><strong>1. Weight Loss.</strong> The main purpose of black soya. Weight reduction is due to increasing the activity of fat cells. Those allegedly begin to burn fat, regardless of the amount of food consumed by you, including, if you have no physical activity. In addition, thanks to soy protein, according to advertising, the muscles grow without any training.
<strong>2. Improvement by saturating the body with useful substances.</strong> The site Product asserts that certain vitamins, minerals and amino acids are contained only in black soybeans. Nowhere in nature, they are no more. I wonder what kind of minerals are? If you would like Mendeleev heard, he probably would have got out of the coffin to burn his table of chemical elements.
<strong>3. Rejuvenation.</strong> It is due to dietary fiber (which, incidentally, are in any plant food). The body is rejuvenated as a result of lightning elimination of toxins under the influence of black soy from Japan. After that, according to the suppliers of goods, there is a surge of energy forces in the cell, and you feel much better.</p>

<p>Due to what effect this wonder-drug that reduces weight and rejuvenate the body? If you believe the official site, as part contains the following components:</p>

<p><strong>Proteins.</strong> Present in any food products. They are a source of calories. Promote weight loss, but only if used in place of fatty and sugary foods, not in addition to it.</p>

<p><strong>Vitamins A and E.</strong> So these vitamins, which are found nowhere else in nature, except for black soy! Or is there? Yes, still there. Vitamin A is full in carrots and other yellow vegetables, and vitamin E in abundance found in vegetable oils. Both components are useful for health, weight loss but not in any way contribute.</p>

<p><strong>B vitamins</strong> are present in many other foods. Good for your health, but they do not lose weight and look younger.</p>

<p><strong>Alimentary fiber.</strong> In fact contribute to weight loss. But only if the abundance of dietary fiber in the diet causes decrease in consumption of other foods. By themselves, they do not burn fat.</p>

<p><strong>Amino acids.</strong> This protein structural components, so that in fact when transferring the composition manufacturer repeats the same material twice. As mentioned above, from the proteins do not lose weight if they are a supplement, not a substitute for the usual ration.</p>

<p><strong>Trace elements.</strong> What kind of minerals are in the black soybeans - the manufacturer is not recognized. Given that nowhere in other products do not, in general, these micronutrients to mankind is not known, to evaluate their real impact on the shape and health is very difficult.</p>

<p>Black soybean are sold as a concentrate. You will receive a jar of powder. It must be diluted in a glass of water and drink before each meal, three times a den.Takoe use of black soya will help in weight loss, as it will reduce appetite.</p>

<p>Of course, this will not happen because of the presence of this plant amazing fat-burning properties. Hunger subsides as the day before the meal in the stomach will be less space. As a result, you eat less. If this happens regularly for at least several months, you will eventually be able to normalize the figures.</p>

<p>Black soybeans - is one of hundreds or thousands of useless goods for figure and health that is actively circulating on the Internet. It pacifiers in a beautiful package. They are sold on the colorfully decorated sites and skillfully advertised, but because demand. Nevertheless, the man who would be able to lose weight and rejuvenate with the help of black soybean, the world does not know.</p>

<p>This product is recommended to buy the people:</p>

<ul>
<li>The rich - who do not consider $ 40 money, worthy of attention;</li>
<li>Curious - who are used to check for yourself;</li>
<li>Stupid - who believed in a bright, but not the most convincing and reasoned advertising;</li>
<li>Desperate - who wants nothing to do with his own figure and wants to clear his conscience, allegedly fighting <a href="http://medusanews.com/diseases-and-conditions/dietology/obesity.html" title="obesity">obesity</a> even with the help of useless supplements.</li>
</ul>


<p>The rest of the people recommended to use other methods of weight loss. There are supplements better. However, keep in mind that without the support of the diet and increase physical activity, no medication is not going to work.</p>
